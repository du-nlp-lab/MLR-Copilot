Title
Dataset and Baseline for Automatic Student Feedback Analysis

Abstract
This paper presents a student feedback corpus containing 3000 instances of feedback written by university students. The dataset has been annotated for aspect terms, opinion terms, polarities of the opinion terms towards targeted aspects, document-level opinion polarities, and sentence separations. A hierarchical taxonomy for aspect categorization covering all areas of the teaching-learning process was developed. Both implicit and explicit aspects were annotated using this taxonomy. The paper discusses the annotation methodology, difficulties faced during the annotation, and details about aspect term categorization. The annotated corpus can be used for Aspect Extraction, Aspect Level Sentiment Analysis, and Document Level Sentiment Analysis. Baseline results for all three tasks are provided.

Introduction
The paper introduces the need for a comprehensive dataset for automatic analysis of student feedback to improve the teaching-learning process. Previous datasets were limited in scope and lacked comprehensive annotations necessary for detailed analysis. The authors aimed to fill this gap by creating a dataset that includes detailed annotations for various aspects of student feedback. The introduction outlines the importance of aspect-level sentiment analysis and the potential applications of the dataset in educational research.

Related Work
The related work section reviews existing datasets and methodologies for sentiment analysis and feedback categorization in educational contexts. It highlights the limitations of previous works, such as the lack of detailed aspect-level annotations and the focus on document-level sentiment analysis. The authors compare their work with existing datasets and emphasize the novelty of their approach in providing a more granular level of annotation.

Research Tasks (t)
The primary research tasks undertaken in this study include the creation of a comprehensive student feedback corpus, consisting of 3000 instances of feedback written by university students. The feedback data is meticulously annotated for aspect terms, opinion terms, and the polarities of these opinion terms towards targeted aspects. Additionally, the study involves the development of a hierarchical taxonomy for aspect categorization, covering all areas of the teaching-learning process. Baseline results for Aspect Extraction, Aspect Level Sentiment Analysis, and Document Level Sentiment Analysis are also provided, using the annotated corpus as a benchmark.

Research Gaps (g)
This research addresses several critical gaps in the field. One significant gap is the lack of detailed aspect-level annotations in existing datasets, which limits the granularity required for in-depth sentiment analysis. Previous works have primarily focused on document-level sentiment analysis, neglecting the need for a more nuanced understanding of specific feedback aspects. Another gap is the absence of a comprehensive feedback dataset that includes both implicit and explicit aspects, annotated with a detailed methodology. The study also tackles the challenges faced during the annotation process, ensuring accuracy and consistency in the data.

Title:
Dataset and Baseline for Automatic Student Feedback Analysis

Abstract:
This paper presents a student feedback corpus containing 3000 instances of feedback written by university students. The dataset has been annotated for aspect terms, opinion terms, polarities of the opinion terms towards targeted aspects, document-level opinion polarities, and sentence separations. A hierarchical taxonomy for aspect categorization covering all areas of the teaching-learning process was developed. Both implicit and explicit aspects were annotated using this taxonomy. The paper discusses the annotation methodology, difficulties faced during the annotation, and details about aspect term categorization. The annotated corpus can be used for Aspect Extraction, Aspect Level Sentiment Analysis, and Document Level Sentiment Analysis. Baseline results for all three tasks are provided.

Introduction:
The paper introduces the need for a comprehensive dataset for automatic analysis of student feedback to improve the teaching-learning process. Previous datasets were limited in scope and lacked comprehensive annotations necessary for detailed analysis. The authors aimed to fill this gap by creating a dataset that includes detailed annotations for various aspects of student feedback. The introduction outlines the importance of aspect-level sentiment analysis and the potential applications of the dataset in educational research.

Related Work:
The related work section reviews existing datasets and methodologies for sentiment analysis and feedback categorization in educational contexts. It highlights the limitations of previous works, such as the lack of detailed aspect-level annotations and the focus on document-level sentiment analysis. The authors compare their work with existing datasets and emphasize the novelty of their approach in providing a more granular level of annotation.

Research Tasks (t):
The primary research tasks undertaken in this study include the creation of a comprehensive student feedback corpus, consisting of 3000 instances of feedback written by university students. The feedback data is meticulously annotated for aspect terms, opinion terms, and the polarities of these opinion terms towards targeted aspects. Additionally, the study involves the development of a hierarchical taxonomy for aspect categorization, covering all areas of the teaching-learning process. Baseline results for Aspect Extraction, Aspect Level Sentiment Analysis, and Document Level Sentiment Analysis are also provided, using the annotated corpus as a benchmark.

Research Gaps (g):
This research addresses several critical gaps in the field. One significant gap is the lack of detailed aspect-level annotations in existing datasets, which limits the granularity required for in-depth sentiment analysis. Previous works have primarily focused on document-level sentiment analysis, neglecting the need for a more nuanced understanding of specific feedback aspects. Another gap is the absence of a comprehensive feedback dataset that includes both implicit and explicit aspects, annotated with a detailed methodology. The study also tackles the challenges faced during the annotation process, ensuring accuracy and consistency in the data.

Baseline Comparisons
* Compare the model's performance with baseline results provided in the original study and other recent works.
* Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance across different tasks, including Aspect Extraction, Aspect Level Sentiment Analysis, and Document Level Sentiment Analysis.

Step 4: Iterative Refinement
Feedback Loop
* Implement an iterative feedback loop where the model's predictions are reviewed and corrected, improving the model iteratively.
* Engage domain experts in the review process to ensure the relevance and accuracy of the feedback.
Continuous Learning
* Utilize active learning techniques to continuously update the model with new data, ensuring it remains up-to-date with current trends in student feedback.

Step 5: Deployment and Application
Integration with Educational Systems
