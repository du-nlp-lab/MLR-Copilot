##

MLR-Copilot is a framework where LLMs mimic researchersâ€™ thought processes, designed to enhance the productivity of machine learning research by automating the generation and implementation of research ideas.

It begins with a research paper, autonomously generating and validating these ideas, while incorporating human feedback to help reach executable research outcomes.

## Framework Overview

MLR-Copilot operates in three integrated phases:

1. **Research Idea Generation**: LLM-powered agents generate research hypotheses and experimental plans based on existing research papers.
2. **Experiment Implementation**: Translates experimental plans into executable experiments using retrieved prototype code and models.
3. **Implementation Execution**: Runs the experiments with mechanisms for human feedback and iterative debugging.

## Quick Start

[Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1aMh94R1Nl6r0wTzRVJFzsx-S3pwadmFD?usp=sharing)


### Setup

Begin by cloning this repository.

#### LLM Configuration

- Place the following in a `.env` file at the root of this project:
  - `CLAUDE_API_KEY`
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY`

- Configure the Hugging Face Token as needed so that `huggingface_hub.login()` works if you intend to use Llama.

#### Local Version

- Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### Docker Version

- Obtain the Docker image `tortcode/nlp-coresearcher`:
  - Build: `docker build . -t 'tortcode/nlp-coresearcher'`
  - Or pull from Docker Hub: `docker pull 'tortcode/nlp-coresearcher'`
- Run `bash container.sh` to start the container.

## Experimentation

### Task Creation

- Place the research idea in the file `problems/<task_name>`.
- Run any preparation scripts as needed.
- Place all starter code in the directory `workspaces/<task_name>`.

### Task Execution

- To run the agent with a specific task and LLM (Claude, GPT-4, or Llama), execute `bash run_demo.sh <task_name> <llm_name>`.
  - You must have access to the Meta Llama 3.1 models in Hugging Face to run Llama.
- To ignore error logging, redirect stderr to `/dev/null`: `bash run_demo.sh <task_name> <llm_name> 2>/dev/null`.

### Task Logs

- Full logs are under `logs/<task_name>/<start_timestamp>/agent_log/full_log.jsonl`.
- Other logs are under `logs/<task_name>/<start_timestamp>/env_log/`.
