D760EF65B80C,"Many people think that it is a great idea for high school students to only attend three years of high school education, by taking courses in the summer or in the evenings, It will allows you to graduate a year earlier than your orginal class year, I prefer to attend all four years of high school education, which means that i would attend all four traditional years of high school education, such as: Freshmen year, Sophmore year, Junior year, and Senior year, which is the last year of a student high school education. The reasons for my disagreement are: Age problems, Graduation issues, Lack of Experience, and Shortage of a summer break.

Firstly, lets talk about age problems that people who follows this plan are going to go throught. Freshmen students should be starting thier first year of thier high school career around the age of fourteen or fifteen years old, So they can graduate while turning the legal age of eighteen years old in the United States, Which is the correct age of finishing thier high school education. Sophmore students should be starting thier Sophmore year while turning the age of sixteen years old. There are few students that start thier Sophmore year at the age of fifteen years old, Which means that they attended thier first grade in Elementry school younger than others.

Secondly, Graduation issues, Graduation should be the most significant accomplishment in anyone's high school education, When following this program, You are not going to be able to graduate with the same class year as you for example; I graduate with my orginal class of year twenty-twenty. If following this program, you are going to be ahead of your friends and class year.

Thirdly, Shortage of summer, students only get two months as a summer break in the United States, before attending thier next school year. By following this program, you are not going to be able to go on vications and rest from the year that you attended. You must study the classes and cources that the program gives you, so you can finish all of your credits and graduate while your family are on vications having a good time.

Finally, In conclusion, this program will mess up your summer plans and would not benefit you with any new progress. I suggest the traditonal four years of high school education."

Working in Groups or Alone

In school sometimes we work in groups and sometimes we work alone. Working alone is fine because we don't get headaches from classmates; however, working in in groups is better because we get extra help from classmates. Working in groups is better because we get extra help from classmates, we get more opinions, and it takes less time doing the assignment.

First, working in groups is better because we get extra help from classmates. For example, we divide the assignment with our classmates. Each person has their own part to do and we finish it faster than do it alone. Working in groups is better because we will have more contribution from classamtes.

Second, working in groups is better because we get more opinions. For example, every person in the group give opinions. We get more ideas if we are more than only one person. We don't have to think everything about the assignment because we will have thinking help. Working in groups is better because we get more ideas.

Finally, working in group is better because the assignment will take less time to be completed. It will take less time because we will get more support and all the work don't will be completed just by one person. There will be more help and each person will do a little work what means that we will finish faster because it will take us less time doing the assignment than do it alone. Working in groups is better because the assignment will take less time to be completed.

In conclusion, working in groups is better because we divide the work with our classmates, we don't have to think everything about the assignment because we will have thinking help, and the assignment will take less time to be completed. Working in groups is a gift. "
9FE2FE6E997E,"Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"". Do we accomplish more if we are doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? Keep doing something helps you get a chance to accomplish and also makes the time you spend out is worthwhile.

Determine means you have reached a decision. Firstly, once you have determined yourself, you will know what to do forward. For example, you are having trouble with your weight so you are planning to be fitness. You spend two hours a day going to the gym or go jogging every early morning. As the result, you will lose weight and have a nice body. Secondly, determination can be a supporter for you to reach your goal. For example, you are a senior in high school and you want to graduate this year; however, you are having trouble with your grades. You try to improve it by asking teachers and you friends, or you go studying online and do some practices at home. If you do that everyday, you will get good grades and graduate.

Determine can also make your time more worthwhile. Imagine after all the time you have to spend on doing something are now accomplished, you will feel very pleasant and proud of yourself. The more time you work, the worth time you pay. Otherwise, it can make you have more patience in life. You will not stop chasing on what you want to do although you have to face many problems in life. Therefore, you both get good accomplishment also a better personality.

In the other hand, being idle in determining makes you are a useless person. You will have no job, no money, neither future. For example, you need to buy a house but you have no money. Instead of finding a job, you do nothing, which makes you waste time and get nothing for your benefit. Beside that, idleness will make you have no respect from people. Although people are working and getting success, you just sit there and get failure.

It is not hard to determine what to do. Making lists is a way. It helps you analyze a lot of things to work on, makes you have more accomplishment, and you will become a successful person in life."
690713606EEF,"I disagree because students don't only like sport or making year books and student council students also want to try other things like art, music, computers. Students like other things not all students like the same things. There are other things to try out extracurricular activities. I think the principal should think about other extracurricular activities.

Like other schools don't have only 3 extracurricular activities there are other extracurricular activities to think of like I said their's art, music, cooking, chess club, drama, computer, science, math, reading, writing, anything else not only sports making year books or student council if they repeat all 3 extracurricular activites that dumb boring and

Maybe some students may agree with these decisions some student will not argee because not all students share the same personality or have something in common and some students like sports some don't some students don't like making year books some students don't like student counciling. In my personal opinion art is a activity I want.

There are many extracurricular activites I want to do I would do art reading and drama because I love to draw I love to read marvel comics especially Dr. Strange Spider-man Guardians of the galaxy and black panther I love drama because I am going to be a actor, and a director when I grow up and I know a lot of students don't only want to do sports malking year book or student council students love other things. I know a lot of students and people opinion.

If you must participate in one of these extracurricular activities well everybody will think schools boring but the thing is it's the principal decision and chose if he or she want all the students to participate in at least all 3 extracurricular activity then you really have no chose but anyone can still disagree on all extracurricular activities maybe you can ask the principal if you dont want to do any of the activities."
D3A6B04B54A9,"Should school have a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall? People said most students enjoy summer vacation, but some educators feel that the summer break is too long and that students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall. Some people argue that there should be year round schools, where there would be a 3-4 week break in summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. However I believe that students should have a longer summer break because a long summer break will give the student time to travel, spend time with their family, and work in summer. The first thing you can do by having a long summer break is travel overseas without worried about how many day you can stay. By travel overseas you need time to explore the country go around the city, and enjoy yourself. Cause travel in a different country you can learn new thing that you never learn anywhere, or experience the thing that you learn in school like go to a history site that you learn from history class. Traveling is not all about playing around didn't learn anything, but you can have your choose of where you want to go, and what you want to do. There are one type of travel that I think is really good for student that they're going to have fun, experience, and still learning. It's the tour during summer break with your teacher, and your schoolmate. It's recommend by school where you can come to a country that you learn about their language, and culture in school. There are a lot of different thing that you need to get ready to go to another country, so you can't get everything done in a week of spring break. The second thing you can do by have a long summer break are spend time with your family, and friends. When summer come you, and your friends plan to go on vacation together because all of you have the same summer time even if ya'll come from a different school. Because all the schools doesn't have a same winter break, or spring break that is the reason why you, and your friends can't go to vacation together. Family is the most important thing for everybody. On summer you can spend more time with your family, or go visit cousin. Summer are the students break, but their parent still have go to work. The 3-4 week summer break is too short for students to have a chance spend time with their family. For overseas students that even worse they're study in a year, but still don't has a chance to come back to see their family just because the short amount of time that they have for break. The third problem is the student work on summer break most student are get their job during the summer. Because with the amount of time you available to work for them, they will hire you. For a student work in the summer is the best choose when you work on summer you can save a big amount of money to use during the year, and don't have to go work during school year, so you can be more focus in school. With a week off in winter break, or spring break you can't find a job because the short amount of time. Some people say their should be a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and week off spring and fall. It's will help the student return to school without forgot everything that they have been learn. However I disagree with this idea I believe there should be a long summer break by that student can do what they want, and still learning new thing. I think a long summer break is the best time in a year for students travel overseas to study in the United State like me. Because this is the only time in the year we can come back to the motherland to meet us family, and visit cousin. During school year we can't come back to our country to celebrate holiday like Christmas, or mother day...etc. We have to celebrate a lone because the limit of the time won't let us make it home. A long summer break will help the student overseas spend more time with family because there are enough time for them to get ready, and travel a long way home. For students that live in United State you can go travel with your family to make more memory. When students have enough time to enjoy them self in summer it will help them return for school in a exciting way, so they can learn faster. "
C1C75CB3BB17,"Dear Principal,

I'm against for having a grade B average or up because a lot of students wants to play some sports too. Their's a lot of great students who's really good at sports and some other activities, but has bad grades. Many students can improve their grades, a C is a good grade so why can't they play.

Playing sports can help make some students want to make their go up. If grades from A,B,C could their will be a lot of students playing and having fun, so if only students with grade B average could play there won't a lot, less than with students with grade C average to play, and by the way not everyone likes playing sports so everybody with a C or up could play maybe the team could be full. This is my reason about that students with grades C average or up could play."
EAB299C6ECED,"First Impressions are almost impossible to change this is true but they can also slightly change a little bit over time. I personally agree that is almost impossible to change an impression about someone so lets say that I agree and disagree because the statement is right but not everyone is the same, your thoughts and the way you think are different from everyone else, so the way you feel about a person could change over time. The first impression of a person about you could change over time just like your first impression about someone you've never met before could change as time passes and yall get know each other and hang out, go out to eat just like in a relationship, when the girl meets the guy and he looks so handsome, respectful, polite, nice, generous, very responsible from her point of view, when his at school, work, even when his home or even to the point of calling him sexy even if he is the skinniest guy ever you would tell him ""Wow baby, you're so sexy"", even if his not you would say it because you wouldn't want him to feel bad or anything to ruin that bond but when you guys start talking even more, start to hangout more often that bond will start to grow stronger in confidence and trust so when that time hits, It gives us a whole 360 degree spin now you start to be more open with your partner and you actually start saying the real things, Im not saying you have to lie but people in specific try to cover their lies with other lies and some times it dont even work or it don't add up at all but what Im saying is that when that right time actually hits you start being more open and you're not afraid and for the same the reason, you guys develop your ways up and work it out to the point of building a really strong trust, that confidence in you guy's eyes, that key to your heart and let everything be free.

It will take a while for you to see the prove but probably not to long but the results will come at one point and don't doubt it. however, with your first impressions you will represent yourself to the people or the way you act or the way you act in the beginning it will make them know if your child dish, immature, or the opposite.

If you put that respect and honesty in the beginning people will treat you with respect but if you like to mess with people yell at them without respect don't expect something else because it will come back to you and there's this verse in the Bible that I like that says "" what you plant, thats what will grow"" I don't think i wordily got it right how i said so what its meaning is if you're a lair don't be mad or don't ask God why is he doing this to you because that's what you planted in the beginning. When you meet a person what are the first impressions you get of that person on how they look, act and talk. When I first came in Generic_Name class and actually met her, my first impression was she's very nice, knows how to properly talk to students and as time pass I got my points proved right. Sometimes it is almost impossible for first impressions to change but its never to late it could come to the time it does."
CDDCA13DB734,"The determination make us to do something and do not stop until we finish, in the prompt show us a little piece of all the wisdom of Tomas Jefferson ""

determine never to be idle... it is wonderful how may be done if we always doing.

"" it make think about how much a person can accomplish is the person is always doing someting.

If we always are doing something we learn more. For example: I work with my parents in construction and thanks to that I learn many things that I can use for my future.

We can accomplish almost everything. Why I said almost? for the simple reason: do you like what are you doing?. Example if you want to do the best doctor ever, but your parents want you be a famous lawyer; you will strive for be a doctor no matter what.

We will learn the value of the things that our parents do for us. Example: I come from of a little country in Latino America. Generic_City is a beautiful place but is poor, violent and do not have the sufficient money for live; in Generic_City if you have a car it means that you are rich or you have a good job. but I born in a place called Generic_City in the state of Generic_City in the rural part.

now I am very graceful of my mom come here, because if I still live there i could not finish high school or middle school, but thanks to my mom I can dream for go to a college and speak more than one language.

All those reason make me want to give the best of me in everything, and always do somenthig and do not seat and wach the world rotate and do nothing for the people that I love, and my new country."

Occupations Through Internship and shadowing to discover

Many schools have partnership with companies that allow students to explore certain occupations through internship and shadowing opportunities to discover. Many schools look for the best for you to graduate and to have the best paying job, like I think it's a great idea that the school let's them go out to discover many things that we don't even know and things we never even knew that it excited at all. Students this days don't even know what they want.

I would and will do it of convincing my principle of school to let kids to explore bunch of things like I said before like trying to take them to field trips for them to learn how to use credit cards and take them out to explore nature and study countries.

The oppurtunities to discover will take him to the highest of knowing what he will really want in his future and college for a fact that many kids don't take lead for being scared. Taking the biggest step ever to learn the new life becoming adults. You should never listen to people taking because they will want one thing and another you should think of what you really are passion of working without any complain.

I would convince my manager to take me many places so I will be clear and happy about it. Lets say principle or manager to lets explore new things like better paying wage job like that you won't be killing yourself.

That would help of us thinking if we learn something we love it we can even make our own business and will make lots of money. that will be a fact why asking your principle for many things of going out to explore bunch of things, like that you won't be worrying about money, paying stuff, and won't be dealing with bosses because I hate that they pressure you so much. If I ask to explore I would love to learn to read panels of when they build houses and buildings because they make a lot much money since their isn't much people to do that.

If your parents don't afford shouldn't be a problem if you have good grades you can earn scalerships to pay for them, You just worry about going out and finish high college of 4 years and enjoy it because you will definitely miss it after wards.  "
11E5C01714C5,"Dear Generic_Name,

Our school gave opportunity to us, students, that will allow us to explore occupation through your internship. Although, some people may say that it will just be a waste of time for students but for me its not. As a student i don't want to miss any opportunity given to me that will help me to be more prepared for the future, give me more experience, and lead me to success.

Firstly, this internship will help me be prepared more for the future. Since I'm still young I still haven't made up my mind on what kind of job i wanted to have, so through this internship i will have the chance to explore the occupations that i can get and make up my mind and have a decision. Therefore, this internship will help me on being ready for the future.

Secondly, this internship will give me more experience. Experience is great way for learning and discovering new things. There's this saying that ""You will never know until you try"". For example, my friend hated the thought of her dancing but when one of our teachers asked us to dance, she discovered that she was really good at dancing. Through this internship i may discover things that never really crossed my mind but actually good at it.

Thirdly, this internship will help me lead to success. This internship will help me plan for my future and not just do anything that will cross my mind. After this internship i already know what job i should get, know what to do and what to expect, and be more confident and more prepared. This internship will lead me to success because it will help me boost up my confidence and help me do better on my future job.

If i were to be selected i will do my best and everything i can for this internship because i don't wan to miss the chance of being prepared for the future, get more experience, and most importantly will lead me to success."
9B4BD1687FA0,"The quote says, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you already mastered, you will never grow."" I disagree with this statement. Because people need extend their studies, so that they can learn new important information that can benefit new research, also they can set new ideas, so they can make new studies and discoveries. Thirdly they can grow by teaching other people how to learn the same material . You can grow be doing a lot of different activities and teaching methods

First way to grow is to try to learn more by studying. This is an important factor to learn more about in full detail like Isaac newton he discovers the law of gravity because of an apple that fell on top of his head. Then he makes a lot of theories about what may cause such phenomenon, so he studied it by creating equations and and a math subject called Calculus. Their are many others for example: Shakespeare, Beethoven, Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawkins, and Leonardo DaVince. These smart men did not stop because their is always something new to discover and grow.

Second way to grow is discovering new information. Every single day people learn something new, which is a benefit our society weather it's good or bad because you can have new ideas or discoveries. An example is cancer. A deathly decease that can kill you and there is no cure. Scientist are doing experiment on trying to find a cure and that takes a lot of time to gather information. These scientist do not stop even though they mastered science. They want to continue helping people from suffering this bad decease they want to grow and learn more they will not stop until they find a cure, so people can live as long as possible with their families.

Third way to grow is by teaching other people. Teaching other people can help you be a better person and letting people know your methods, so they can succeed with your help. Doing that will help yourself and other. It's another way to a good mentality, also you can grow bigger.

In conclusion there are different ways to grow even though you mastered it. That is why I disagree with this statement, and their is never enough or to good to learn. I will never get tired of learning new fascinating stuff about this world and the outer world."
AF98232BDB08,"Some schools use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes. Students shouldn't use their cell phones in classroom for educational purposes its going to be big problem with teachers and parents if they are using their phones in class and teachers are going to be conserder about how bad they are going in school their grades are affecting them. I disagree i dont think that they should be allowed to use their cell phones in classroom It distracts them from learning and paying attention in class if they use there phones in class they will not know or learn the important information that the teacher is teaching cause what the teacher teaches is about what you need for your education. One reason is that They dont do their work if they have their cell phones they might be saying that they are getting their work done but they are not doing their work their doing something else on their cell phones. For example instead of them doing their work in class they are really playing games, watching movies listening to music , talking to their friends on the phone texting them they spent all their days in school using their phones doing all these thing that they shouldn't be doing and that won't help them in their education. A second reason why students shouldn't use their cell phones in class is that they aren't learning anything in class they dont listening to what the teacher is teaching in class its not helping them learn new things and have knowledge for other things and won't be really for quiz or test. For example when a test is coming up they don't do well on because they haven't been listening in class; they were too besy using their phones playing games, watching movies or whatever they were doing on their cell phones so thats why they get bad grade on their test and have bad grades throughout the year then they can't do anything to get their grades up before the quarter ends. Some say that cell phones are useful for school to have them as a resoucre when they need to find information about things their trying to look for. But they are wrong students don't need to be using their cell phone in their classroom at all it just distracts them even more from what they should be doing because if they are going a project for a class they don't need their cell phones with them they can find the information that they need by using other resource to get what they need for their project. For example if they are trying to find how to cook or bake they can go to the libary and look for a books that are about cooking and baking or they can also ask their teachers for help they won't need their cell phones to find their research. When we know that if they have their cell phones with them they won't be doing their work they will be doing other things that aren't importante. Thereforce that is why students shouldn't be allow to use their cell phones in class or when they are at school so that they can paytention in their class and learning what the teacher teacheing them everyday in class and like that they dont get bad grades. So student dont need their cell phones at any point in school they shouldn't be allowed for educational purposes they dont need to have them to distract them from learning in school."
2D63639F997F,"Is it having a possitive attitude the key to succes in life?

If someone would ask me if a possitive attitude is the key to be succesful in life. I honesty would agree with them. Because in a big part of life everyone is going to have to deal with ups and downs, Some more than others but everyone have to go through something bad for something good to happend. everyone have to fight for what they want, and on that fight is going to be bad parts and good parts but if you stay possitive most of the time you are going to win the fight , accomplish what you were loooking for and be succesful, But if you aren't just keep trying and be possitive everytime.

Always have possitive thoughts a possitive attitude and keep trying, Get up over and over intuil you accomplish your dreams, Do not give up because if something i have learn is that if you give up and think negative, you would never be succesful and know what you are actually capleble of, Thats why a lot of people is just stock in the same place because they are scare for what is going to happen, Because they have more negative thoughts then positive ones, That's making them not be succesful in life, thinking that they are better where they are and not where they can be.

A example from my life is when life just decided to punch me in the face, just change my life. About two years ago when i was in freshmen year of high school, my doctor told me that i have a bad arteria is the vein that gives oxygen to the heart, So i had to have a heart surgery.

This is how everything started, One day I woke up got ready to go to school, went to school like usual. at the time I was in middle school, Generic_School, I was playng soccer and i have got to tired went to the bathroom I felt like something wasnt right, I drop to the ground and felt nausia, I didnt give it any atention and just kept going with my day like normal. Almost around six months later i had another mini heart attack, But at the time i didnt know what it was. I was just laying on my bed and i just started feeling a sharp pain in the chest, But it went away in about 30 minutes. when everything got serious was later on about another six months later when I was at school at the time i was almost finishing freshmen year at Generic_School, my chest started to hurt badin class, So what i did was go to sleep in class and see if it would go away, Then when i woke up the pian wasn't there anymore. I wen to my house and about 4 hours later the pain started again and it was bad so I told my mom and we went to the emergency room in the hospital. At the time i had a infection in my trought so the doctor said that it was doe to the infection, then they told me to go to a heart specialist. The apointment was on a monday my mom had decided that we wern't going to go so she call the place to cancel the appointment and they told her that it was important for me to go because it was something serious. They told us that what i had was mini heart attacks, he told us that i was going to have to get a heart surgery because there was more posibilities for me to die of a heart attck then to die during the surgery, so i didnt have any other choise more then take the chance and have the surgery done.

The whole time i was pissitive, I wasn't scare at all i didn't have bad thoughts. So the day that i was going to have my surgery finally came. The doctors read to me all the chances that i had to die if something went wrong bacuse they had to stop my heart and conect the veins t a machine so they could work on my heart, i was just calm and thinking possitive all the time with a smile on my face and having a possitive attitude. I had my surgery and everything went perfect in a week i was out of the hospital, In about three months i couln't wait any longer so i got a job start working making moneyand going to school, always possitive. And now i am makin almost

$1,100 per week and i'm just 18 years old still bought my second car crash it fix it and sold it then I bought me a 2017 Subaru WRX STI and my life is just going better and better some down and ups but getting up no matter wha, always trying and giving bad moments a smile and always possitive because things always are going to hapend but that's how life is. I dont know where i would be right now if i had a bad attitude all the time, and negative thoughts, thanks god i'm still here alive.

Hope you guys like it and remeber always possitive attitude.     "
B4CF5269C465,"Is it a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the work force one year early?. Some students take courses during the summers or in the evenings or may not be able to take elective courses that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. It would be a bad idea as students need more preparation before go to college, because students need advanced classes, time to know what they want and get more opportunities that help them in college.

Some Students dont be prepared go to college when they graduated. because some people know college is more difficult than schools. for example: My sister graduate early to high school and go to college, when she take the test she dont know the answers; because ask to her about classes that she never see in high school, she lost the test and she had to pay for take that classes before to start with her profession. Is it not a good idea to graduated early as students can get all credit in high school and star to take more advanced classes that they need to college.

Some students take one year more in high school to take advanced classes. For example: my best friend dont have the money to pay college and they want to get a scholar ship in high school, he has all the credits and sol's that he need to graduate, but he take another year; because he want to take advanced classes like physics or difficult classes that he need in college, and is it opportunity to learned classes that you need in college free. but if a students have just three years to graduated when they go to college they dont know nothing classes that they really need.

It would be a bad idea to allow students to graduated in three years as they dont be prepared to the college. students need to experiment elective classes and find what they want because some students when graduated dont know what they want to do after graduated. some people said is better go to college one year early and be professional early however a good professional is not who get all diplomas early is who have the more experience and know more about that.

In conclusion, allow students to graduated early is a bad idea. students need prepared more before go to the college and get time to take the opportunities to take advances classes or get scholar ships that they really need in college. A good student is no who finish their high school early; is who know and learned more that they need."
638D7F913AAB,"Do you think the greatest accomplishment in the world is to be yourself in a world that is trying to change the person you are?, because I do not think people should change themself ever for what god brought us in the world for who we are and not changing ourself for others. So yes, I agree with Emerson statement about individuality, because people in this world are trying to change themselfs for others or just changing themselfs because they dont like themselfs for who they are. There are so many reasons why I agree with this statement especially in today's society that most people in this world are changging themselfs for someone else. I don't agree with the fact that people have the courage to change for others, because in any case they should just be thereselfs and love them for who they are, is the greatest accomplishment and feeling ever.

It is the greatest accomplishment because of the feeling that you loved yourself and secceeded without someone bringing you down and making you change yourself is the best feeling to feel. Otherwise the people who are trying to bring you down are winning and you are giving them the power that they should not have. In today's generation with all the social media we have people that have been rude and comment someting bad to make you feel bad about yourself and then some people change themself just because of a comment that could hurt someone. But if you can secceed people will leave you alone, because they know you will not listen to the rude comments you would recive and there just wasting there time. So then you have the power and accomplished the negetivity that people are trying to change yourself.

Also being yourself does not mean you wont have mistakes because everyone does and that is okay just without you changging yourself and accomplishing thing is the best part of life. It is okay to have mistakes because everyone learns from them and next thing they will do better then the last time they did something bad or had a mistake. People will go through tough times but it does not mean you should automatically change yourself for that. Everyone goes threw a situation that they probebly think they hate themself and wanna change the person they are, but I think that is wrong and they should be thereselfs and understand that everything will be alright at the end without them trying to change themselfs.

In my opinion I do not think that changing yourself will help with anything and I think it would probebly make things worst. LIke for an example if you change yourself nothing is gonna happend just you letting yourself down and changing who you are that should not have been in that situation. Also people would most likely notice and ask why you change yourself and that would bring back memories and make you go back in time and see why you change yourself. But if you dont change yourslef no one would know and wont bring up any badly past back memories. Also mistakes can happend and if you change yourself and go back and see old pictuers of you of how you used to be you might not like for who you are now and you cant go back because you change yourself for someone you did not want to be I mean you could always try but why try after you did it and cant go back.

So just be you and do not change for others who are constantly trying to make you something else who it is'nt you. It is such an amazing feeling and more people in this world would be great if they would'nt change for someone else because they would get the confidence and not worrying about what others has to say about them. People would most likely be so positive if they would be themself and not changing constantly or ever themselfs for people who are ignorent. People who love you would never say to change the person you are because that is just wrong and they know that they would not want to lose you as the person you are. So in all saying that everyone should not change and be themselfs in a world that is constantly trying to change them. "

Some schools offer distance learning as an option for the students to attend classes from home by way of online, or video conferencing. Student would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online because is not teacher help, and cheater.

F13C7EC54868,"I agree that the programs that allow students to graduate in three years, will be a perfect idea and everyone must like this. As i know some students really need to graduated early some of them need, to help their parents with some money. It's a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college early.

Some districts are offering programs for students ; for example they are allowing them to graduated in three years some students need to help their parents with some money. Also they want to graduate early because of college this programs really help students and high school.

Students who follow all this plans they have to be persistent to graduate in three years. To illustrated students wants this programs to be able to have the things that they want ; for example buy a car buy some clothes. Also students enjoy to hang out with friends so if they graduated early, they will work and have some money to buy what do they want. Students must follow all this plans to see the results.

While some people think that it's a good idea for students to finish high school and three years to enter college early, others argue that students don't learn enough in three years. There are several's ideas that improve this such as they didn't focus in learn more about assessments. people think that they don't learn enough in three years, they missed classes that they might need in the future; for example construction class we don't know if one day we are going to work in construction then we will need some skills in that job . Also advanced PE we are going to needed it for our healthy students need to know more about other classes that they might need it in the future.

I think it's a perfect idea for the students who wants to get a diploma in three years. Students need to work to help their parents for example pay the bills and all that. Also students wants to work the year that they have off to save some money for college. In conclusion i like this idea because students have opportunities to be a better person in life."
E0B4FCC6FD58,I feel like best way is working with a group is great idea because you have the chances to meet new people you dont know and have little convestions with them while working on getting ideas and finding the right respone for your work on what the teacher gave as a group. Well one good reason on why working with a group is a good idea my opionion is because by working in a group you can find different details on what the teacher given what to work on in a group yall can bring up all the information yall came with or got from the internt and have argument about which one should be the best answer. Another reason on why is a good idea working with in a group it's a easy way to get a better garde as a group and working in a group is really fun you get to talk and use the computer sometimes the teachers let us use our phone and we make like a little group chat for us to talk about the work she told us to do and share our answers on the group chat and see who agree with it or who don't and we all got different reasons and at the end of the day we pick the support detail and use it. My benefits of working with a group is that if you are one of them students who really want to be in a group and help people and on there work show them how smart your are and that you in the group of people you are a hard worker.

D0A218161D37,"Prompt essay

People who value self-reliance define it as they need for each individual to follow his or her own instincts and ideas. Should people make their own decisions or should they seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters?

People shouldnt make their own decisions,because they might do something and the need someone thats cam help then or else their going keep doing bad decisions and if they make bad decisions they can get in trouble,problems and etc.

Some pf the people think that they make the best decision but they might be wrong because they always choose the right one or the wrong one it depends on how good are you making choices not always their going to chooser the right one.

Just like how it happen to someone his told him that he could help him go to college but the kid didnt want to go to college as far I can see now he regret not going to college why? Because he made a bad decision his dad could help him but there was a problem he didnt want to go to college. Now he have to work 8 or 10 hours peer day and when he juts could go to college study a carrier that he likes but now his suffering why? Because he didnt make a good decisions. He should be working as a lawyer or Doctor.

There is some people that they dont believe in themselves then juts do whatever they think is good for then but it doesnt work that way they gotta make a decisions a good decisions if they are under 18 years old they have to ask their parents father or mother. they can help him.

61445D1ABF16,"One...two...three...START! Identify an enjoyable educational activity such as doing the science fair, singing, playing an instrument and many others. In my opinion, the most enjoyable educational activity is art because it makes me less stressed out, I could find new styles, it could be my future career.

First of all, it makes me less stressed out about everything. Whenever I take a test, I will start to over think a lot and loose concentration. Most of the time, I will always doodle on my paper because it lets me concentrate more and loose my mind a bit. I mostly take a break whenever I'm taking a test just to calm myself down a bit and doodle. Personally, I took the SOL yesterday and I mostly doodle half of the test because I was over thinking too much. I was stressing out really bad yesterday and I just doodled on my paper. I always doodle on my notes, my work, and my test because it's really fun in my opinion. It helps me a lot and make me concentrate more often now by doing a simple thing like doodling.

Second, I could find new styles in my art. I am a self-taught artist and I like trying out new styles. It's very interesting sometimes and very fun to do. It may be really complex for me but I still try my best to get the hang of it. In my opinion, it is really creative and it may also shows your feelings about life. I could draw how it's like to be scared of the dark or being scared of heights. One of my friends have sleep paralysis and most of the time she draws about how it feels like to have sleep paralysis. It very amusing to me and interesting because it can tell a story about my life.

Additionally, it could be my future career. Since drawing is my favorite thing to do in life it could be easy for me to get a job that deals with art. There are many art programs in college and I'm mostly interested in doing animation. Animation is very complex sometimes depending what type of animation am I doing. There are two main types of animation, 2D and 3D animation. 2D animation is more like a picture and many cartoons use 2D animation. 3D animation is more realistic and it's a lot more complex than 2D because you have to model objects, humans and many others that I could add. 2D animation is more like just drawing on a piece of paper while on the other hand, 3D I had to mostly use a program for to just do 3D animation. Most of the time it is hard to find a job that you want and it takes time and hard work to get it. Mostly my future job would be an animator since I've drew so much in my life.

I love doing art because it makes me less stress out about everything, I could find new styles in art, and it could be my future career. Art is mostly my favorite enjoyable educational activity in school and many other places. It is very enjoyable in my opinion and it really helps me through tough times in life. It could be very hard sometimes but it is still fun to do."
F4FC2D64C127,"Inactive Times and Its Benefits

Should people have inactive times in their life? By doing work all the time people can achieve more goals; however, is better for people to have inactive times. It is better for people to have inactive times because they can have a longer life, fresh ideas, and get more energy.

Firstly, it is better for people to have inactive times because they can have a longer life. People's body works better when they have time to rest. For example, my mother's friend had a heart attack for not having inactive times. His doctor recommend him to have lazy times because he was working eighteen hours per day, but he did not listen to what the doctor said. As a consequence, he pass away; however, before he was told to have inactive times, his Neuron System stopped working properly. He stared having bad times at night while he was sleeping, his body started shaking, and he started having heavy breathing. The doctor asked my mother to talk to him and explained one of bad results, and that was death. Right after my mother's friend pass away, the doctor wrote on his blog about how not having inactive times can kill us. In sum, having inactive times help people live a longer life.

Secondly, it is better for people to have inactive times because they can have fresh ideas. When our brain is full of tasks we cannot think clearly and have new ideas. Being busy makes our mind blocked. For example, Generic_Name is a teacher and she is planning to have a party. However, Generic_Name is been so busy because her class is having a competition. All she thinks about is the competition and how to prepared her class. Generic_Name is not having inactive times and she does not know how to organized the party. She tried to focused on the party, but each small action was in vane. Her boss noticed she was tired and did not have new ideas, so her boss let her have two days off. During those two day Generic_Name could came up with lots of ideas to her party and also ideas to the competition. Generic_Name was happy because her main was full of new and fresh ideas. Her class won the competition and her party was amazing. In conclusion, by having inactive times people can get fresh ideas.

Thirdly, it is better for people to have inactive times because they get more energy. People who rest feel more energetic to start or finish an activity. For example, when I have many homework ,exams coming up, and track practice I feel upset, frustrated, and with no energy. So what I do is rest for a while to get energy. This make me feel powerful and energetic to finish my different activities. Furthermore, in my Psychology class I learned that people who rest or get an inactive time after they done with an activity for twenty five minutes have more energy to continue another task. In my personal experience, I have tested it on my sister and the results were successful. For example, She had to do an Algebra II homework and then, an English homework. So when she took the first twenty five minutes after she finished her first homework she said, she had energy to do the other one. We test it again without having twenty five minutes break. She said she was tired to do the next homework because she did not have energy. In sum, it is better for people to have inactive times because get more energy.

In conclusion, it is better for people to have inactive times because they can have a longer life, fresh ideas, and get more energy.

People can faced catastrophic result as death by not having inactive times and affect our life time. In addition, when people have lazy times they can came up with new ideas to complete different tasks. Finally, when people rest a certain time after an activity they get more energy. Each individual on earth must have an inactive times. "

C92C73888D49,"In my opinion

Thomas Jefferson wrote a statement that makes people think that, there's people out there who don't accomplish if we are doing something or we are not doing something. No one is grateful for peoples struggles and hard work they may thank you but they won't mean it.

Imagine being in a world where people thank you for every single thing that makes you feel respected and needed for more work and accomplish what we suffer for and we do it because of the need of some personal struggles your going through. If humans were different by showing others there help and respectful this world would of make every single thing differently. Some people are accomplish of your hard work , some people never care others people hard work they just say thanks without meaning it and can say stuff behind your back.

Although humans think they doing the right thing, they aren't we should be a world without cruel no one knows how damage a person can be and fake it just because they want to accomplish the work they have to turn in or be finish with because they will know that if they don't finish the work it would be harder for them to get rid of you with your negativity. For example people don't serve Hispanics equally for differences but most of us have but our effort on work hard to earn some cents to take to our family but no one sees that all they do is put there own rude opinion on us. We shouldn't care what others say as long as you know your a great person with a huge heart your good.

It would be wonderful how much may be done if we are always accomplishing others people work and being grateful for peoples effort, it would be a great idea if every single person listen to our life story before talking. Can't you imagine how many kids needs our help and we might see them with some eyes that we think there okay but they are really not. Humans have the benefit to change and become a different person and accomplish a goal to become someone grateful for little things and make the world a different place with different though.

We should take a position to serve people with kindness, respect and give them a hand for there need of help sometimes helping others can make you a great person you can never know one day you will need the help of someone too and you will feel how much it hurts to not receive help from others or by someone you though wold of help you out you should always tell people how grateful you are for having them because they will realize you once helped them and they will help you out on the need of help, they will serve you as how you will serve them by now on, you can't judge a book by it's cover,

Thomas Jefferson wrote "" Determine never to be idle.."" and what i think about what that means is that you should not be ungrateful and you should help others, with simple words that are accomplishments.

The studies of

Thomas Jefferson old days history probably were different they did things differently and though different ladies suffer in the old days, now everything is sort of different they accomplish women for the things they do and treat us better than how women were treated back in the days ,

Thomas Jefferson wants things to be different and probably doesn't want people to do the same mistakes they did in time of history. We should all be a group of good people and do the right things the right way. We can make this world different if we stand up for others and help the world who need help and accomplish them with needs they need and everything would be different and make people think different."
D7766B98F761,"It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. I believe that attitude is everything in life. Having a negative attitude can be helpful when someone is defending themselves for what they believe in, but having a positive attitude might change someone's life and at the end of the day you feel good about yourself.

It's important to have a positive attitude in everyday life because your reputation goes up, others want what you have and you set a positive mindset for yourself.

First, having a positive attitude in your daily life will raise your reputation. For example, you are at a job interview, you dress very properly for this job interview. When you first walk in the room, you greet the interviewer with a smile and a handshake, and you start to introduce yourself. That gives the perfect first impression to getting the first place in this job. People in my life have taught me that giving positive attitude around my peers is very important, because having a positive attitude can change what someone think of you. In summary, being positive in a job interview will get you that job that you've been working for your whole life.

Second, people around you want what you have when you show positive attitude. For example, you are doing a group project, you don't know any of the people you are working with. The first thing that you did was to introduce yourself with a big smile, and then you ask for their names. All those people in your group sees that enthusiasm, and they think "" Man! She must be a really nice peson, I wish I have that kind of positivity in my life."" Someone in that group might not been having a good day that day and they saw how positive you are and they want that same positivity that you have.

In summary, a person giving another person positive attitude can help others to be the best that they can be in life.

Third, having a positive attitude can set your mind on positive things in life. For exmaple, in 1999 there was a shooting in Generic_School, 200 people died and 500 people were injured. It was a very sad event for both families and friends. A girl name Generic_Name was injured badly that she has to be in a hospital. But what she said in the hospital that caught everyone's attention was that "" I may be hurting very badly right now and I may or may not be able to walk, but I am glad that I am still alive, and that i get to see my friends and family's faces right now"". Generic_Name was injured so bad that she couldn't even walk, but she had that positive mindset that at least she's not dead. In summary, positive attitude will switch your life around in life's hardest moments.

In Conclusion, positive attitude is the key to happiness and success in life. One person being positive about something, the others follow. That's what so special about positivity, it spreads everywhere you go, as long as you are positive. This changes people's lives every single day.

When someone have positive attitude, your reputation goes up, people want that positivity and you have a positive mindset in everything you do. "

882F6EC806E9,"PROMPT

In my opinion, prompt is a something positive attitude in our life, and I agree with that because we have to learn how to be prompt. Next, a positive attitude is the key to success in life because we can go far with that, for example: In my future I can get my goals and get everything in my life, that is, a car, a big house, and things like that. Then, I agree with the positive attitude, that is something important to do and to have a better life. Also, my idea is, if we are positive in our life, we can get a lot of success with our goals.

I can follow these list to see what I can do to a positive attitude.

Do something interesting

Search something new

Talk with a trust friend

After that, some people disagree to a positive life because I think they don't have something in their life, like a good future. Something interesting,

a prompt help us to do everything fast but is not good,

because can happened something bad.

A positive attitude is the key to success in life because that's something important we have to do, if don't do something good we don't have a better life, we stay in the same way, for instance, each day we have to know new things, for this reason a agree whit that. I believe to success in life because I can get a lot opportunities. In my opinion to have a positive life, we can relax, read books, listen to music, go out to walk or talk with some good person, these can help us to forget the problems or something bad in our life. Be positive is something can help you to do what you want in your life, and other people to be positive.

Later on, my mom said, I have to be always positive and try any thing new, I think that is true because some times when I can't do something, I try do it like 3 times, after three times I can to everything to myself, so that's a good idea to try every thing what we can't do.

A prompt is something what can we do fast and done quickly. Prompt can help us to get everything done early but sometimes can happen something bad, so have to always care and think what we going to do first.

In conlcution prompt, I agree with that statement becuase I like to get everything done and get something better."
4AAD1243DE3D,"Having a problem can lead to success if you try your best. ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best""- Duke Ellington. Everyone has problems in their lives even if it's a small or big issue, everyone wants easy fix problems but sometimes having them can give people chances to do their best. Being in a big issue where people don't know what do to, they will have to take chances and having to think to get out of the situation.

For example if someone forgets their homework at school some choices are to print the homework at home or at a library. Not knowing what to do on a homework is never good but trying your best, even if it's wrong. Duke Ellington is right because taking chances to do your best is great and you never know if something you made or done could be used in the future. Every job have situations for example builders may not have the materials that are needed, or teachers may not be able to read the handwriting.

People who do parcor have to do their best to not fall off a building and if they are in a situation where they can jump to a different building or thing they might have to take chances and do their best to get to the other side. Anything can be a problem but if you try your best that is all that matters. "
CA11FD3CAC43,"Many people have been told about the fact that the students should know the career they want in high school and learn about it. Therefore, many societies around the world, are expect to provide help to the students to find the career they want to study by the time they enter high school. In fact, many schools select the courses for the students based on the career the students choose. In addition, many schools think that the students should be young when they think about the career they want, just to make sure that they will not change their minds in the future. So, it is a good idea to commit to a career at a young age.

Based on that, students will have time to prepare themselves to be ready for the career they choose. Students will be able to make sure that the career they choose is good for them. If students are prepare at a young age for the career they want, then they will be able to enjoy it. For example, I want to study interior design, therefore, I have to take art classes to learn about colors and how to combine them. If students choose their career at a young age, they will be more prepare and have better results while complete their life goals, because life goals are very importat to have a good life's quality.

Also, students will be able to see if they like the career they choose. It should be a good idea for students to know themselves and what they like, because it is unpleasant when a person have to study what the parents want him or her to study just because they could not have done what they wanted to do. So if the schools support students to find the perfect career for them, then this disagreeable situation will stop. In many cases, people that had to choose a wrong career have to deal with a unhappy life, because they do not feel well in their jobs. Once again, if students have the school's support, they will be able to find the perfect career for them.

In addition, students will learn about the career and how it works. It might not be noticeable for people the fact that nothing is how it seems, some careers might seem to be easy and be hard, or the opposit, the career might seem to be hard and be really easy. For example, it is easy to judge a lawyer when he do not win a case, but we have no idea how hard the work he did can be. In my 19 years in this world, I learned that nothing is as easy as we want it to be, but if we search information about what we want to do for life, we will be happier, that is a fact. Schools should require an essay in which students can write about what they like and what skills they have.

So, students should know what they want and what they are good in. If students learn about the career they want they will have the opportunity to be great professionals. If the students start learning about the career they want at a young age, then they will have plenty of time to prepare themselves mental and phisically for their future career. Also, students will be able to see if they like the career they choose so they do not regret it in the future. And last but not least, students will have time to learn how the careers work, so they will have many ideas of how to complete them. In conclusion, it is a great idea for students to commit to a career at a young age by the time they enter high school."
F11E6745A8DA,"I think this is benefiting being able to stay at home and do online classes sounds good. I agree because doing online class it goes on your own paste and you wont feel to rushed to finish, another good reason would be doing online is that you dont have to show up to school anymore so youll get to sleep in and wake up whenever. My final reason is if someone if decides to go to college they'll be ready because thats how college is online.

Think about not being able to have time to finish your work and your teacher saying you only have 25mins or by the end of class everything needs to be finished? well that wont have to be the case anymore because doing online means youll be going at your paste and you wont have to rush to turn things in. For example, I take an online class, so for me I already know how it works and honestly I think its way easier because no teacher is yelling at me to hurry about or I dont have to turn in incomplete work. so I like doing the online class is also fun because I be at home while doing my work in my bed.

Rough day at work, and you know you have school the next morning? Well no worries because you get to sleep in and do you school work from your bed. Thats right, dont have to wake up early and go to school. Just chill at home in your bed and do your work. Thats why i agree that we should have online classes because Ill enjoy my bed and do my work from home.

finally, last but not least college. if you ever plan to go to college then best believe that college is online class and video conferencing. Nothing new go to the library and study from there who wouldnt like that.?

In conclution online classses and video conferencing is the best way of learning. yes they benefit from learning and it helps them out. "
9A5193D1C19B,"Positive attitude is the key to success in life. It has a big impact in our life, and remove negatives thoughts in an incredible way. Also, if we do not start thinking in a positive form; life will be hard for us. Furthermore, positive attitude guarantee a different way of thinking it can change the way we are, and how our minds are more open to others opportunities. I agree with positive attitude because it can change our lives for a better future. Positive attitude is the thing that all humans needs in life.

Firstly, if we have a positive attitude our lives can change in the way that very few people can reach. For example, we will gain more opportunities to jobs like have a good recommendation of the society, finding jobs would not be that hard,

and gain to have more friendships. In addition, other case is the behave with the family that almost all young people has for example: having good communication, feel good around them, etc. Also, discussing with other people would not be a issue because we are prepare for how negative attitude appears in the persons who does not want to change the way of think. Moreover, our positive attitude can change the mood of a person.

Secondly, positive attitude improves our mind state in the way that negative thoughts cannot go into our brains. However, sometimes this negative thoughts can also ruin our day by putting obstacles like, the boss is angry and we do not know how to react, having a bad lunch, or no having enough hours of sleep. but, positive attitude has a big impact that right away make us think in a different way and make us feel secure. In sequence, an experience at school that all human being has is when we have a test and we are worry that we will not pass, the teacher comes and say ""is not a big deal, i know you all can do it"" and that is where positive attitude comes. Also, positive attitude has to influence in everybody, so we can have a better world.

Thirdly, we all are different, but we can try to improve our skills in positive attitude by reading books, listen to other people, and make a change in our habits. On the other hand, we can try to make contact with people that has positive attitude to the maximum, they will help us to see things from a different perspective of view. In addition, introducing new people in our lives will make a big change. Also, it will make us more responsible at the time that we have to read, write, or talk in an appropriate way. lastly, this will lead us to a better and different way of think; it will improve our knowledge.

Lastly, positive attitude can support us by building a better future for our lives. But, sometimes it can be difficult to manage our emotions. Positive attitude can improve us to do better in our emotions. It will make us strong in whatever situation we are passing through. A lot of people that are around us would not like it but, is a process that we want for be different than them. Positive attitude is ambition for those who wants to live better and wants to reach their dreams."
F98FEC21D9EA,"Should School Extend Two More Hours To The Normal Schedule?

One topic that is frequently debated is whether school should extend the day schedule or keep a normal schedule as they have it already. Some people think that school should not expend two more hours to our normal schedule. They feel that if we spend two more hours at school, it will be boring and tired. In my opinion, school should extend two more hours to our schedule for many reasons: I can spend more time to learn in classes, spend more time with friends, and work one more day during the week.

Once, I was pretty nervous about my Earth Science SOL test, I did not know what to do to pass it because I never passed any quiz or test that we did during the school year, and I felt worried because I did not understand some topics, and I only had one week to learn everything, so I decided to stay everyday after school to practice with my teacher and by myself at home, after a couple days of practicing I realized that I had learned what I needed to learn and I felt ready to take my SOL and finally, I passed it. Now I know that spending more time in classes helps us to understand what we do not understand yet, learn more about the topics that we are practicing in class, and get ready for any test that we have during the semester.

Sadly, I am a Senior, and this is my last year in High School, and that means that maybe, I will not see some friends and teachers again, so I am trying to enjoy everyday in the school expending time with friends and teachers whether during lunch or during classes, and I think that spending at least 25 more minutes with them in every class will help us to know more about each other, and to make more experiences to remember after we graduate from High School.

As some students, I do not have a permanent job or an everyday job as some people call it, I work for a moving and storage company, and that means that I can only work Saturdays and sometimes Sundays because I come to school and they ask me to be ready in the company at 7:00 am when I am going to work, but having a free day school during the week would benefit me because I would be able to work one more day during the week, and earn extra money to buy something that I might need.

As you have read, I am agree about extend the school day two more hours. Only when we realize that spending more time at school would helps us to learn easier, make a lot of experiences with friends and teachers, and gives us a free day school to work, to do homework, to spend time with family, or do some chores at home, the world will be a better place with students that understand what they need to understand about their classes, and people who takes advantage of at least one day free per week."
BE2532E0867B,"Technology, it may be a helpful tool, but it's also a distraction which affects adults and children. This means that now, almost everybody are so into technology in certain way. I get that people use technology because of their jobs, but for other people is a distraction. I'm not saying it's a bad to have technology, what i'm saying is that now people don't hangout like they used to, they don't go shopping anymore now, they only want to be at home this is why, I considered a negative effect to people's lives.

Now almost teenagers, don't hangout with their friends anymore because they just can face time or call them without going out of their house. If they do hangout they are only on their cellular devices and not socializing; that's mean to the person that they are hanging out. They are only worried about their social media for example, they only see how many likes, comments and followers they get. Also, about what people say about them in social media and if they get tag in a picture. This is how people is now, they don't see the importance of talking to each other, they only want to know about what people say about them in social media.

People now does not want to go shopping stores anymore, which this means that stores are closing because of people buying everything online. So buying everything on online is the new thing on technology, therefore people now doesn't need to go out to buy what they need, now people just can order it that's why, they are being more lazy. For example, if they want pizza they just order it online or they saw a cute dress, but they didn't wanted to go to the store and buy it, they just order it online. And they get it to their house, so they don't go all the way there.

In this generation, almost everyone stays at home because they just want to be alone watching Netflix or being in their cellular device. Back then, people always went outside and play with their friends in the streets. It was fun to play with other people, people enjoyed it. Sometimes they even got the chance to meet more people. Now, if they want to be play with other people, they just download a game on their cell phones, computer or even on social media; now they have games too. Also, people used to go watch a movie or hangout at least, but now people stay at home because they can see the movies or playing videogames with other people online.

In conclusion, people don't hangout like they used to, they don't go shopping anymore, now they only want to be at home. Technology had people changed a lot during this generation. But, what i have seen technology is a negative effect on peoples life. This why it's not a good thing of having technology, because is keeping people away from the other people. It's a distraction that's taking away from not talking to family, friends, etc.                                "
52DC3B7C3952,"Working From Home

Should students be allowed to attend classes from home? I agree that attending classes while at home would be beneficial for many people and can actually help them work better. One reason is that it would be less stressful for the student and put a lot less pressure into getting the work done. Another reason is that it would give them more time to work, for example they could relax and take little breaks while working instead of having to cram all that work into one class session. My last reason is that it would help improve grades. If a student is allowed to work while being at home, it would allow their brain time to think more about their work and how they can improve it.

Attending classes from home would be less stressful and put a lot less pressure on the student. For example, one class session is an hour and thirty minutes. Teachers give a lot of work to students and expect them to get it done without any problem, but the problem is they can't because being forced to do a lot of work is not very fun and with very limited time can put a lot of stress on the teenage brain and also damage their mental health. Expectations now a days are really high for students but their mental health and state aren't taken into consideration.

Time is of the essence. Students need time to get their work done and whatever they aren't able to complete becomes homework. Having to do a lot of work without being able to take a break can really suck. Imagine if you had to do a bunch of work without being able to take a rest because whatever you don't complete you're gonna have to complete at home. If students could work from home, they'd have all the time they need to get their work done and they could take a break if they got too tired. At home students wouldn't have to worry about time because they could complete the work at their own pace.

Grades are important, and when a student gets a bad grade, it isn't exactly the best look. Working from home would allow students more time to think about their work, when in a classroom students can't spend a lot of time thinking because they don't have much time. On the other hand, being at home would give them all the time they could possibly need to complete their work and how they could improve it for a better grade. If students could improve their work they would get better grades, and there's no better place to do that then home, the place you're most comfortable with.

To sum it all up, students should be allowed to attend classes from home because it causes less stress and pressure which is better for their mental health, gives them more time to think and do their work, and helps improve their grades while in a place they're more comfortable with."
23D5BA721F52,"Do you always have to be honest at all time?

Well do you agree with me because I do think you should be honest.

Well sometimes it is not good to be truthful because some people are crazy humans in this world. You should always be honest to your family. They appreciate you more than anything. I think being honest will always be great think for this generation. The benefit of being honest at all times because your friends will know your trustworthy,parents love that more than anything,and you're not a lair.

My first reason is your friends have more trust in you. They will have a better friendship most likely. Friends will buy things for you like shoes,shirts,and shorts. Some times friends don't like that much honest because they might feel sad and stress out like when my sister came back from Generic_City from college. My sister friend was honest but my sister felt sad because it was heartbreaking to her. But any away my sister is find now living her best live. Your friends will dislike your honesty and like your honesty. They might tell you secrets that they never told there parents.

Another reason is parents love you more if your honest in my opinion. They care for more than anything. They gave you a life. Even if your friend said something very bad you should tell them anyways because they will probably help your friend that is need of help. They love you more than anything. Being honest to your mom and dad are the most. In the past I will always lie and you can picture the next thing. Sometimes parents hate when there child tells everything to there cousin,and which my mom hates children .

My last reason is your not gonna be a liar if you become honest at all time. In my religion if you are liar or not honest at anytime you are a liar. God will forgive you if you ask forgiveness. You will have better life and future. I sometimes like being honest because adults like hearing the truths and I wanna be that kind of kid. I like being that good kid and quite kid that loves being friends from a long time ago. I hate when people lie than walk and they try to be honest. Sometimes people I think should not lie and e honest.

In conclusion, the benefit of being honest at all time because is great for you. I think being great will make your family great as well as people around you. I think friends will love you more than anything. You are a great human being as like your parents. I think having a wonerful time being great person. As being honest everybody esle will be honest. Some honesty is bad for other friends are cool with it. God will forgive you as well as your parents. The honest person will always win.

The most thing i do in that class is play basketball which i am trash at it but i still play with the boys and i enjoy the time .Another thing i like to do is soccer because its playful and playing with friends is more better. Because it helps you with teamwork,speed and skill.

Soccer is my favorite sport because when I was little I would always see all the games. And i would enjoy it because soccer is my family favorite thing to do when we are bored and its nice outside we would play like two hours and before we play soccer we would have steak and enjoy the temperature. And after the steak we would play soccer with my uncle and some of my dad's friends and we would play soccer until we would get very tired.

So back to p. e some people think that p. e is boring but i think that it is fun because thats when most of the time i play with my friends and i would enjoy it mostly because thats like the only time we would be free a and out of school work and play with my friends. But the other thing is that when we are at p. e people don't like it because some of them are tired and some of them are just bored at p. e i don't really get it but they just think that it is so boring or their tired of doing anything.

P.e and soccer are technaclily the same thing because they could run around and they could enjoy their time with some friends but like i tell you that there's people that doesn't like doing p. e. So i don't know what people say about it but i enjoy p. e because its enjoyable to do it to not the test but the activity's they have.

And soccer to they have lots of training to do but the rule is to have fun and play nice for you can enjoy the people and the coach. so if you or any one else is bored than try doing soccer for you can not be that bored anymore so just be playful a and play right for you can not be that bored at anything anymore so just try it one day and i highly recommend you that you will like playing soccer

But like i tell you if you are that lazy that you can't even do anything then you have to try one thing. Because you have to try something because you can't live a life that you can't even do anything you have to at least try to do something in your life so yeah thats all i have to tell you so play something right not bad. Just try to play soccer don't be that lazy and do it."

Some students said that is a good idea, because is less than energy, and we can safe more resources but,I think that when we have homeworks and we don't have computers in our homes we have to make that homework in the school, library ,warhawtime or in the classroom but what happened if we don't have energy in the computers ?

We can fell some points of this class for not make that homework on time .

Is this happened in two hours of a day of school imaginated four days of school ?

This can be a problem for students because we don't have resources to make our homework on time ,and we can feel really bad about this problem ,we can have problem with our parents too.

Some students have the resources in their houses because they parents can pay for that and is the reason why they said yes is fine to conserve energy and resources in the school ,but other students they can't because their parents can't pay , or others reasons like they don't have their parents here, they have just mom and their mom have more daugthers or brothers and she have to pay rent ,car ,bills we really don't no but are a lot reason why they can't pay for internet .

I think that energy and resources in the schools is not a bad idea, but for some students is a good option to make homework and enjoy of them with accesible confidence, if we don't have energy for four days of school can be really hard to make everything at the same time like other students because we are a lot students and we can't use that same computer at the same time because is not the same homework or is not easy to find it and we can take more time then others, that's why I think that is not a really good idea for all students,

Other students think in not because some students use that internet just for see facebook or video games and they lose time that other can use , but they can't talk for everyone because some students use that internet for really good reasons like homework , read books , and other things .

Other reason to not conserve energy can be the air conditioner if we don't have energy the air conditioner is does't work and depends how is outside the weather can be affect at the students, and teacher because what if is snow outside and we don't have air conditioner we can get sick or pain in bones, if we don't have energy we can't charge the phones and we can't talk with our parents or if we have an emergency and we don't have energy how we called at the ambulance ,is that's why energy is a really good resource to comunicated with other and make somethings importants .

In benefits ,we can safe more energy because we use the energy just in limited time , the bill of the energy in the school can be less than then before and we can have more resources for our school too .We can have differents activities outside.

In conclusion , if we don't have energy for four days of school ,everything can be hard for us ,some businesses can be conserve energy and resources because is a different condition in their business , but for schools the energy is a good resource to the knoledge of the students . "

When students have confidence is important because they can turn in their work with out thinking about getting a bad score, Students can put their best effort in their work and they have confidence they'll have a good score. when students have confident they want to participate more in class do class activities, Students having confidence is important because they can have a positive mindset and they have that confidants to teach other.

Students having self-respect is important because they learn how to respect them selves and others, when self-respecting they think about what they are going to say before they talk sometimes students didn't mean to say it in a wrong way do they make them selves look bad and others start making fun of them. when we have self-respect we learn how respect our decision how to talk with manners.

Setting up goals is important because you build off the skills you already know and getting better. when i was in art class i kept getting bad grades and i never thought that i was going get better at drawing, but I set myself a goal to get better at drawing go i started practicing everyday and started to build off my skills and eventually i get better at it. Now i love drawing with a Passion. when students set goals they can get better and achieve more then they can ever imagine they could. setting up goals and achieving is a good representation because it's showing them that they can achieve and do more than they could ever imagine

As you have read self-esteem is build off by effort, achieving goals and having self-respect is how you get better . only when we have self-esteem students learn better in classes because they will putting more effort on activities in school be more confident with answers and not be shy about getting it wrong students learn from studying or from their mistakes."

E91431653DE3,"Prompt

The author Waldo Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, about to be individuality. I disagree with him because there are many occasions that you need help from someone in life. Is not just to be individual is to know how to management your life in your time. In this essay i will talk about some ways the we can work together. Firts i will explain about, job issues and results. Second i will explain about society, and how can be relative to be not a individual person. Finally i will expain how to take decisons, and to make them work. This may prove that individuality doesn't change the you can not be, what you want be.

There are many ways the can be a ocation of individuality. In your job, might be someone you do not like, because his or her behave. You can try to work with the person, is not just be a individual person, beause you might need the help of the person one day. If your try to work with the person to broke the individuality between the person in you, that can be a avance to be relative to other people. Another occasion on individuality in your job can might be because, you are not doing what you dreamed about to be in the future. The doesn't mean the you can not fight to get your goal, if you don't like your job try to do something the you like been working in a job that you don't like is typical of individuality behave. Many companies work together as a team to get there goels, you can work with other people in your job as a company.

Some people prefert to be alone in many times, these people we can know as asocial. This people just want to be alone becuase they feel comfortable like that. There another people the doesn't like to be around others people, because they like to do the things by there own. They like to be the one the everyone see, the point of attention these people we can call as indiviluatys. Not all them are the like that, because there might be a reason to makes them to be like that. Maybe for their background. Be around of society is sometimes is more complicate then what it looks, mostly if you know people like that, but you can try to work with them or somethings these people chage. Some them beacuse they look for help and others change because someone close to them help to change for good.

We all make decisions in life but some those decisons can make us to do something wrong or to be a different person. Try to be anoter person is not just to want to be the person is to make a decision. You can make the decision to be push it by the world, or you can make your own decision of what you want to do in life. Many people take the decision to stay in a world that management their life, because they think the is better or because is the easy way. The president can deciside to work alone, and make the things as he wants but he knows the he needs to work together, we the people in the congress beacuse by himself can not do everything. As the president we can make the same, decision as him to work together or not. you can make your own goal to fight for what you want or to be constantly push it by the world to change you to be something else.

In summary we all have the decision to select which way to follow. As i went throught about job and result. Also i wrote about hoe we can live around the society, and how we can result conflicts. Finally i explaned how we can take are own decision, to be what we want to do, and what can be goal to follow to change, or fight for it. This can be a result the Ralp Waldo Emerson, is wrong about to be push it by the world constantly, beacuse you change that and be what you want to be."
22BF4720FB84,"for this issue, I think attending classes from home by way of online or video conferencing would not benefit. Students would not benefit to attend classes from home because not just for studying in books but we go to school for another reason also, for examples we go to school for getting friends and that mean we have social. And another is we can do activities that we get from some classes.

First, friends form school is the reason that students cloud go to school because they will get a good relationship and that mean they have a socialite. If students attend classes from home they might get just a thing that teacher teach them but they will not get a teamwork when they have any work group form teacher. They will not know how to be a teamwork or working with another people. When they graduate for high and get into college or apply a job and they never used to have a social it will not work for them because they do not know about teamwork or how to live whit a group of people.

Second ,it is about activities for student. When they study,some subject they have to go outside from school for studying ;sure as scenes classes would go to a sea for studying about a sea,so if they go and see a real sea, students might get information more than they get from a book and can feel it. Students should do activities and study in books together it might help students understand.

I think,student should go to school because I believe that we can do better when we do thing that not just read books or study at home but we should go to school fore getting better.         "

ACE3E472041C,"Does taking classes from home benefit students.

People might said that,taking classes from home is a bad idea, that is not useful that kids don't learn and they do nothing. In case other people will said that it benefit kids , that keep them safe and I will agree by saying that taking classes from home benefits kids.

Well I think that parents, who decided that their kids need to take classes online is for one of many reasons. for example , I will provided you three reasons why

I think kids do home classes and it does benefits them and yes they learn from it .

Parents are famous and they cant send their kids to a regular school,kids might be in danger and they can attend school because of that or it might be because they have any medical condition.

First reason why students take classes from home is probably because their parents are famous people and they know that, if they send their kid to any school, people will be chasing them,asking for pictures all the time or may be telling them bad stuff. Parents know that in that situation kids are going to be frustrated about it, sad, angry and defently they will not be able to concentrated at school. It will be hard for them to be free and enjoy school. For example on of my friends he is very famous in my country and also in here wherever he goes people is always chasing him, hi has a kid that is 6 .years old but he said that the hardest part is when the little boy goes out all of these people get to him and he gets scared. That's why he said that he decided to pay for home classes, and they prefer their kids to take classes at home. Kids will feel free and no body will be making them feel uncomfortable.

Second reason it could be because the life of any kid can be in danger and the parent of the kid and also any school will know it. They know that if any kid, that is been treated lets said by any organization, attends to school people will try to harm him or it can become a bigger problem. Because the school will defently knows that if they received that kid at school they will be putting the life of many other kids at school in risk and they will not take that change. Of course parents are not going to allow that their kids to be harm or kill. That's why the school or parents proffered to have their kid to take his/her classes from home he/she will be safe and other people too, the kid will get a really good benefit from it because he will learn and he will be safe and other people will be too.

Last reason why students get benefits from taking classes at home is probably because they have any medical condition and it's hard for them to attend any school. They will feel shame,afraid,scared and they will be thinking that everyone at school is going to make fun of He/She, that they will bully Him/Her and of course as I have said before parents will never for any reason are going to let their kids to be unhappy to feel bad to feel frustrated and feel that no body love them that's why they let their ids stay at home and take classes from it so that way they learn and no body will harm them make they feel worthless.

in conclusion,parents who made the decision to let their kids stay at home and take classes from home they make one of the biggest and hardest decisions in life. Because they know that kids will be safe nobody will hurt them, be hunting them , no body will hurt them, tell them mean stuff. They will not feel embarrassed to let people see them, Parents know that defently is not going to be the same that it will not be the same as if he was listening directly to his teacher and getting his note but they know that at least his kids are going to be safe and they will learn to they will still get benefits from it.

When you want the best for your kids and you love them more that life itself, you do what you got to do if that means to pay for his classes in other to keep them safe,and we all know that people might talk and told you that doing home classes isn't going to help you. But you know that is not true, you got to keep working working hard because sometimes students come to school, but they do nothing. What they do is get in problems fight, with other classmates or eventhey fight whith their teachers,they used drugs at school but. If you know your kid is at home working and you see that he wants to learn the don't listen to the rest of the people."

First, having a healthier school lunch in the school cafeteria will give students a healthy long life. They won't have any blood pressure problems. There body will be able to preform better as there brain. For example, if a student eats vegetable he/she will have much more clear blood than a student who eats meat.

Next, foods that are healthier will have a huge impact on students performance. If a student keeps eating unhealthy food they will constantly be tired and will not be able to perform as well as possible, but healthier food helps the students to perform better and get better grades.

Next, the healthier food means a healthier body which leads to looking good and keeps you away from going to doctor as often as a person who eats unhealthy food. Getting in shape doesn't mean working out, you must eat healthy to be in a good shape. Also, Students will not be sick as often which means that they will not need to visit doctors more often.

5EA0A8768F94,"Students should commit to a career at a young age because they will have more knowledge about their career, have more experience, and if they don't like it they could change it before fully committing to it in college. Being committed to a career early can help you be prepared when you officially start it. If they start in high school they will have more experience about the career and might be able to get a lot more job opportunities. The more experience you have, the more you'll get payed. They will also be able to focus on their career before college and have more knowledge about it. Some people say you shouldn't commit to a career at a young age because if they dont like it they just wasted a few years preparing for a career that doesn't interest them anymore. However if they don't like it they can change it before entering college and have to pay for a career they dont even like and doesnt interest them, thats why its best to start committing to a career in high school. Also when jobs look at your resume and see you took classes in high school for that career and a lot more experience they will wan to higher you. when people see that you are committed to your career at a young age they respect you more and help you out to achieve your career faster. Its best for students to commit to a career at a young age because they will have more time to learn about it and see if thats the career they actually want in a few years from now."
B4B8BEB77C2E,"One topic that is frequently debated is about the benefit people receive to take classes online. Some people think that if someone want to keep study they have to go a school to take that class or the classes that they need. They feel that some people do not deserved the chance to take classes from their home. In my opinion i think that taking classes online is a good opportunity for many people because people can work and study at the same time, those classes can be more cheap, and not everybody have the opportunity to attend a college or an university.

First taking classes online is the opportunity that everybody want, but not everybody have. The people that take classes online is getting many advantages. They can work at the same that they are taking classes, they can take the classes during the flight or if they are in another country visiting their family they can take the classes there. They can do a lot of things during taking classes online, and they always have free time to do whatever they want. But the most important you can help your family in home or and your country.

Second online classes can be more cheaper than attending a college everyday all day. All my aunts that graduate from high school are taking classes online and they are close to end taking classes. They said is more cheap and we can save money taking those classes than attending everyday to a college. They save money and now they are capable to pay and attend a college. I personally think that is a good option for me to keep study save money and got o a college.

Finally go to a university in United States is something that not everybody can do. Because you have to speak a perfect English, you have to have good grades, your GPA have to be great, and for people that does not born here and is not a legal and just have tree or 4 years studying is almost impossible. My sister born here she went to Generic_School she was in the ten best GPA and now is in Virginia Tech University one of the best universities and Virginia. I do not think i will go there i just have tree and half years here, i will take classes online during my parents and me save money to pay a college. I am planing to got to NOVA but i will take classes online first.

As you have read classes online have many advantages that we can get if we take it. We can save money, spend time with our family , visit many places and the possibility to go a college. Classes online is the way that you can get your goal, the way that you can feel comfortable taking it at home. But also is the way that you can work and get money. classes online was made for people like us, that are trying to study and be a professional in the future. "
CF3DC2587708,"I'm strongly agree with the statement of Ralp Waldo Emerson, because unless a people try to do something the person gets more far away from the porpuse. and that happens because sometimes the people lost the interest, and sometimes because the people doesn't want to make an effort or is very difficult to solved it.

while, there are so many reasons why people that think that, their goals are very hard to achieve, because they have to do a lot of test, in those 4 semesters, homeworks, activities, but, suddenly a problem comes to the person life, which is that he has to work at night, have to take care of his mom, he have to pay rent, food, and it's very difficult to think about it, because in those cases is more problabbly that he leave school, and don't follow his dream of graduated from high school or university and get the job that he was dreaming with.

Therefore, even knowing that he was giving up, he started to create a plan, it was a bout a project that should chnge his life, some of his friends tell him, that he will never going to graduated, and that he wouldn't achieve his goal, but, he never give up, and when summer cames. He graduated from the university, 4 months later, he created his own bussiness of tourism and travel.

As a result, he was trying to do something that someone else wasn't doing, he was trying to grow up someting that should make big changes in his life, and in his family. However, I support that sometimes is good to make some changes to your plan, i'm trying to do the same thing, I'm doing my best, to achieve my goals."
EE6114478ECF,"Business manager

Hello I hope you doing well, my name is Generic_Name. The present letter is to let you now that I'm fascinating of your business management, and I'll be glad to visit it. As you probably know many students are compelling to participate, indagate, and discover about distintic occupations in the work place. I think that it will be the most exiting thing that I could do because probably I can find an appropiated place of my interest to work at.

In fact, I can learn about the resposability and most of the times the presure that some workers have. The importance of follow the rules, every little thing in the work place it could be important for me in the future.

To adapt in differents positions and the most imporatnt thing is to love what I would do, to be an applicated, and apassionated person in the place that I would like.

Nevertheless, many people hate their work because they never had the chance to visit many different places that they wanted, couldn't achive their goal or may be the postion that they wanted was alredy taken by someone else.

The resposability at work has to be the most important, if a worker doesn't have the resposability in their job it will be a big problem, they might not care about the job and the things that their boss asked for.

I would like to be the person who has the responsability and all the interest of my job, and be proud of myself by doing the right things.

Althought, I can learn day by day how to impprove without an advice of the manager and be the best worker in my area. Many people think that work is only to get money, and bored and they are there just because they need to pay their bills, the main reason of work is to love what you like and enjoy doing it.     "
74CDAF3BB9EF,"I think that he is right in what he think, about the consists of succession going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm, because if you loss your enthusiasm in something that you are doing you loss the interes in it, but if your enthusiasm is to do it, you can do it many times you want the failure is just a little rock in your way to made your personality more incredible and unique from other that just give up at the firts time.

Enthusiasm is everything you need, when you want to strar something, without enthusiasm we can have a lot of failure if we don't try again and again, it is like the main function of your brain, your personality, and your attitude, to don't have any failure in your life, someone with a great enthusiasm is someone with many opportunities in his life, someone with a good control about what he wants and what he does, someone who doesn't give the opportunity to fail in what he is doing, failure will be always right there in from of you, but your are the only one who accept it or not.

An example of failure can be, ; like when someone went to ask for a job but, he doesn't had the job because he didn't finish the high school that is failure in his life, but he decide to retake the high school in his free time, and he graduate from it, he can back for ask in the same job, he is contracting at this time it was because he has a great enthusiasms in his life, he never stop because he didn't had the job at his first try he continue and he did it.

I know not everything is rose color but sometimes you need a little bit of failure in your life, to see how brave you are and how strong are you for the life situations, failure it's not mean that you are a loser, not it's mean that you are training for the difficult situations in the life but with just a good enthusiasm you can do it again and again has many times you want to do that is my conclusion about how failure can affect your life."
B1C410876D33,"Churchill consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm, he said that because he wants to animate people to not be shy of anything and I'm agre with that.

Some say Churchill go from failure to failure without loss enthusiasm because sometimes people feel shy when they are doing somehing that they don't want to do, like me. I'm so shy when I have to do presentations, I don't feel confortable. But we have to get out our fears, that are killing us to not do what we have to do. People sometimes said that they going somewhere but they said that they don't want to go alone because he/she feels weird, like if you are new in this country, they tell maybe to their cousins to go with him/her.

People should be agree with Churchill statement about the important role that failure play in the pursuit of success because that makes you feel successed and that makes you to be a good person. Actually, Churchill said that because he want to people to not loose their enthusiasm in something that they want and that is a good choose.

People should not be agree with Churchill statement about the important role that failure play in the pursuit of success because I think people don't want to do want Churchill said in the statement and they are not going to follow the statement . Actually, people is not agree because people think that is not importat statement for them and thats why people are not agree with the statement.

In conlusion, people should be agree with Churchill statement because he don't want to people to loose their enthusiasm, that's hy people are agree with the Chuchill important statement because they feel success."

A good attitude is the key of been success in life because you can take new opportunity. Have a good attitude help to see the new opportunity that are out there. An example from my experience is: When i came to Unite State four years ago I was scare to start a new life in a new country. I was afraid to go to school because I did not English. With the time I think and I said to my self that learned a new language will give me new opportunity in me life and will help to be success.

Have a positive attitude is the key of been success in life because help to be flexible. been flexible is the how a person can put then self in a new situation a do well. an example is: One of my friend tell me one time that she argue with a costumer at his job. She is a cashier at a restaurant in the mall it was her first job. She said that the customer get mad and start screaming at her because they did not put something in his food she said that she start screaming at him too. But them she said that she realize that she should not be argue with the costumer. She said that she change her attitude a stop screaming at the costumer and she said that the customer calm down after she change her attitude.

Another good thing of haven a good attitude is that help to face problems. Sometime face problem with a positive attitude help to see solution. There are problem that we think does not have a solution but there is always a solution just need to be positive a figure out the best way to solve the problem. An example is: In my first year of school in United State I took PE2. that class was really difficult for me because me english was not good. But I face that problem be trying my best and asking me teacher or friend for something that i did not now. Have a good attitude with me friend and teacher and work hart help me to pass that class.

A positive attitude is the best way to be success in life because give new opportunity, help to be flexible. help to face the problems. For been success in life is not just work hart all the time is about to have a good attitude too. A good attitude help in work in life and everything a person do. A person need to have a good attitude in their life."
E8E07D453C9B,"Technology allows people to complete many tasks, without having contact with others. People can check out books, shop, and play games without speaking to another person has limitation on humans contact due to the use of technology had positive or negative effects on people's lives. I believe that technology had positive effects on people's lives because we can talk with people in long distance, working online without driving,and find new friends.

The first reason is that technology had positive effects on people's lives is because we can talk with our family that are not with us. Also when we missed them we can video call each other, and know about each others life. For example if there was no technology we can't talk with our families that are in long distance. And we don't know about each other, and maybe we will forget each others by the time past. That's why technology is the best thing that we have in our lives. Everyone should have technology because it's important for them and maybe something happen to you like accident and your family can find you by using their technology and find where the accident is happen. furthermore you can use technology when you are sick and you can't go to your work you can call your boss to tell him/her that you can't come today, if there was no technology it wasn't possible to do these things.

Second reason is that technology had positive effects on people's lives because people can work online without driving and vesting their time. Initially when you working online you can save your money and can do all of your work in your house. However that's good because if you have a children and you want to be with her/him it can help you because you can do your work and be with your child. Furthermore if you can't drive and you wish to work at home technology will help you to work online without driving long distance. Furthermore technology is good thing when you want to travel you can travel and at the same time you can work by your technology, and you can make more money.

Third reason is that technology had positive effects on people's lives that we can find new friends ,culture and new languages. Initially when you go to social media you can see different people with different culture and you want to know about their culture and their languages, so technology will help you to communicate with them and ask them question about their religion, country and etc. Furthermore when you going to some other country that you don't know your way technology will helps you to find your way. For example when you going to the country that you love to know about that country more but you can't ask question because you don't know the people, and their language in there, also you lost yourself in there you can't talk or ask them for help. That's when you can use technology to helps you, you can talk with them by using your phone translator.

Technology had positive effects on people's lives technology helps people with more stuff, and they can use technology as a useful thing we use technology for everything."
8042198ABB06,"Im disagree with extending the school day, because we pass the half off the day in the school and the people won't like that because they want to have time on the rest of the day and do what they like to do.

That is why I am disagree with extending the day of school because we are not going to be able to do what we want to do on the day,If the school add more hours to the school is not going to be good because will be sad because they can't do what they want to do on the rest of the day.

They will be mad at the school because the school will and late and don't have time to do anything because is we get out late of the school and the time that we get home are's parent wont let us have fun and they will send us to bed.

That is why the people won't like a extra hour of school because we are not going to gave fun and we wont be able to do anything about sport.

So that is why we dont what to have extra time of school because it can be boring because we only do homework and we don't go a out side we don't like extra time in the school."
0A1482CD6163,"I agree that "" A problem is a chance for you to do your best."" (Duke Ellington) because I believe that this statement means that even if there is a problem there is a chance for you to improve next time.

One reason why I agree with this statement is because you can improve for next time. For example, let's say you are having difficulty with one of the subjects you're learning at school and you have an assignment due the next day. So you try your hardest on this assignment but when you turn it in the next day you score a low grade,and you go ask your teacher if you can make up that assignment but they say no. Now in this situation the student can learn for this and take this as a chance to improve for next time.

Another reason why I agree with this statement is because something unexpected might come out of that problem. One way is that let's say you are doing a group project for on of your classes and there's a few people in your group that aren't contributing to the group. So you decide to try your best to take the lead of this project and try to get everyone to express their ideas. This shows how a group of student go through a problem with people not wanting to participate but then the student decides to take the lead of the project and try to include everyone.

My last reason why I agree with this statement is because you can do your best on something. One way you can improve the way other view you is by trying your best to solve that problem. For example, if you are having trouble with something then you can try to ask people you know are a teacher for help. This is so you can find the best solution to your problem and do your best.

In conclusion, I agree that "" A problem is a chance for you to do your best."" (Duke Ellington). Because there are many ways for you to learn from this statement,such as you can learn for you mistake and improve next time,something unexpected for that problem,and you can do your best on something."
F8C7B0C9F064,"Some businesses and schools around the world have adopted a four-day of work week to conserve resorces and energy. Although some say that my school should not adopt a four-day of school week and should not extend two hours of school day to conserve resorces and energy because we dont use our resorces and energy in vain , actually my school should adopt a four-day school week and extend two school hours to conserve resorces and energy because we will have a better environment and we will administrate energy.

Those who believe that my school should not adopt a four-day of school week and should not extend two hours of school day to conserve resorces and energy have their reasons. One of the most disputed reason is that, our school does not use it resorces and energy in vain, beause we use energy and resorces to facilitate our studies and to have better opportunities to learn. And they also say that if we have a four-day school week wont make any change.

However, my school should adopt a four-day school week and extend two hours of school day because we will have a better environment. According to an article written in my county says that, ""The used of resorces in my school has increased by 70%. Even more, it says that because the over abuse of resorces in our school the amount of trees cutted has enhace around our county and its harming our enviroment."" That is giving a bad reputation to our school and county because our school does not recycle and reused our resorces .

Also, my school should adopt a four-day school week and extend two hours because we will administrate energy. The using of computers, smart borads, and all kinds of technological devices in our school have increased, do to the extraordinary amount of students our school possess. Our school has the biggest amount of students in all the county. So, do to the amount of students in our school the use of computers has increased. According to an save energy a webside, ""80% of schools energy is used in computers and other technical divises."" By having a four-day school week and extending two hours of school day will limited the used of computers and it will make our school better.

many people have say that my school should not adopt a four-day of school week and should not extend two hours of school day to conserve resorces and energy because we dont use our resorces and energy in vain. But as you can see adopting a four-day school week and extend two school hours to conserve resorces and energy will be benefial to our school and to our society.

Wouldn't you agree with that? What if that was happening at your house? wouldn't you put a limit to the use of energy at your house to make your bills go down? Think about it!!"

DF111089EFA4,"We have to work to survive. Employers give us the opportunity to work and to overcome different financial problems. Many high schools have partnerships with companies that help student to know about different jobs and companies. Some companies have internships and shadowing opportunities that helps student to find out their interest. Schools should have partnership with compamies because it helps students to get ideas about Work environment, work skills, and jods requirement

The partnerships with companies and schools allow student to know waht kind of skills need for different jobs. Then students can find out their strong points and select the jobs according to their skills. Studens are good on math work on computer programing,web designing, and computer engineering. Students without internships activities take time to select the work that they want to grow up. They suffer to select their jobs. On the other hand, students with internships activities already had began to grow their occupation. They are heading toward in college as well as their jobs.

Work environment is very importent. Different people like different work environment. We should select the job that attends our demands. Some people like to work individually while other like to work with group. Internships and shadowing allow student to know about different work environments before select the jobs. Some people may say people adjust themselves with the work environment but the question is how long time it will take a person to adjust with the environment?. Also, in a recent report says that we accomplish more when we work in a favorable environment.

All jobs have some requirments. All the jobs do not have same requirements. Some jobs need experience while other jobs do not need experience. Internships and shadowing opportunities help students to get these information from the employers. With these information student get a chance to prepair themselve. They meet the requirement before their high school graduation. People may say that job requirements can be find out in online, but often we get the wrong information from online. By internships and shadowing we are getting right information directly from the employer without any difficulty.

In conclusion, students are getting a lot of information from the companies that have partnerships with the schools. It is a great way for the students to build up their future. This opportunities gave students ideas about jobs they should select. The informations help students to be successfull in their career life."
EC0B04508F7C,"WORKING IN GROUP

Why the most students like working in group and not alone? the most students prefer working with friends, because in schools the works or homework require more the one students ,but .Some people said of working alone is more benefits for the students. I believe of working in group you can make friends, helping together, and have more time for you work.

The first reason,

if working in group you can make friends because you need talk about the work,

sometime the students speak their experience or opinions about the work,but when the students is not the same country, and the works talk about the country or religious is good because. The students have different opinion and sometime you make friends when you with other students have the same opinion, and when working in group you and your friends have time for talk.

In second reason helping together, because you can ask if you work is good or opinions about the work and look of more information. You can help for materials if you friend not have, and helping together if you consider the work is good or not or change sometime or have or ideas you can tell.

The third reason you have more time for you work if you working in group. Because sometime the teachers not give much day for you work ,and the work is hard, and require much information you can divide the work with you friend . The finally check the information, and put together or you can decide what part you wants working or what parts you can create.

In conclusion is more essay for you if working in group because you can make friends , you can helping together, and you have more time for you work."
9FA90B94782E,"Wow! A talent I have is soccer, I have played soccer when I was born. Loved to play the sport because It always entertained me. So then I started playing more and more of it, and then I started playing in tournaments and leagues. I started of in defense, then I started to up my way up, so then in three weeks I started playing striker. When I started playing soccer I used skills like communication,passing and shooting so then my coach said I had potential in me. So then I started to watch soccer in my T.V..Soccer got famous in the late 1800's. Also in soccer you had to work hard and train hard. Like professionals they worked for 5 to 8 hours a day. Well in soccer games I use communicating,dribbling,passing and shooting.

In my opinion communicating is the most important soccer talent professionals need. Professionals need communication to score or win a match. For example my soccer team always use communication to pass to even score, and to win the match. Pele was a young Brazilian when he went to the world cup finals, he was only 18. His position was striker, he was known for his bicycle kick in the 80 minute. In 1900 professional in different leagues used communication also to pass to ball. Everybody needs communication to win any sport game.

In my opinion you need skills to be good at the game. In one of my games I had to score two goals at least to win the finals in soccer then I two use my skills called the fake. In 2009 there was a player named Lionel Messi he plays for Generic_City and won six ballon d'or. He used skills in games and in training. In my other soccer matches I used skills like passing and dribbling in a soccer matches. There was a player named Ronaldo he played for Generic_City when I was born, so I saw one of his soccer games in the T.V and I looked how he used other skills in the match against Generic_City. So I trained for an hour before my soccer tournament. So then I used one of his skills and it worked. So I used his skills for two games. So I saw professional players skills, so I can use those professional skills in a soccer game.

In my opinion you have to work hard and train hard because if I don't I wont be active so those are my other soccer skills because I train to learn moves, running, and defense. I train everyday so I can get better and better. Other professional have to train everyday to win other soccer matches and communicate with other teammates. I also practice dribbling a lot in my soccer practice. I use it a lot in soccer matches and I really good at it. In 2008 there was a player called Alex Hunter he was a rookie, then he started training and training until he gotten famous and good at soccer. I train everyday when that happened to someone.

If everybody tried to play soccer it wouldn't be boring because it's fun, you can play with family members or friends, and you can know new people."
72765D1D4721,"Should we as students learn from home or school ?. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I strongly disagree with this because some students would not attend the classes from home, some students can cheat on a test or quiz while they are at home, and the final reason is that this can make teachers lose their jobs as teaching and make some students drop out of school.

Many people believe that learning at home by a way of online or video conferencing is a great idea to attend classes from home. In my opinion, It's a bad idea because some students would not attend their classes from home. For example, students can wake up late for these online classes and forget about them throughout the whole day. In another case students won't do anything at home because they are at home relax and doing nothing but, just watching tv and playing video games. What if a student gets sick at home ? they won't do the work that is due while they are at home, some while take like the whole week off and not do anything at all. That's my first reason why we shouldn't attend school from home.

My second reason why students shouldn't attend classes from home is because some studennts can cheat on a test or quiz while they are at home. For example, students can search up the answers on online or use textbooks to help them out at home. I say this because they will use the internet or a textbook because they know that there's no teacher watching them cheat on the test or quiz while they are at home taking it. Students always find a way to cheat and plus if they take a test or a quiz at home, they are for sure going to cheat on it because they know that there isn't any teachers telling them to put their phones away or notes. That's my second reason why we shouldn't attend school from home.

My final reason why students shuldn't attend classes from home is because this can make teachers lose their jobs as teaching and make some students to drop out of school. For example, what if students don't attend their classes at home and also what if the ones that actually do their work do bad on it ?. Teachers can be balme for this because the way they teach it throughout online or video conferencing. This puts teachers in a bad situtation because that means they are not doing well while they are teaching online or video conferencing. Another example is, some students can just drop out of school while they do this at home. For example, if they don't do any work at home they might just drop out of school without telling anyone. Students can give up easily and just contiune their life without any education. That's my final reason why students shouldn't attend classes from home.

In conclusion, some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I strongly disagree because some students would not attend the classes from home, some students will cheat on a test or quiz while they are home, and the final reason is that this can make teachers lose their jobs as teaching and make some students to drop out of school. So in my case you should talk with your principle about this offer, unless there's a sicknees happening throughout the world and it's making school to shut down and do online classes.

1849B89A02D6,"Thomas Jefferson said its amazing how much is done if we work hard, do we accomplish by doing something or does doing nothing have a purpose? If we doing something everyday we could accomplish something like if you exercise every day with healthy meals you will be losing weight and burning calories, if we do not do nothing and don't take care of your self you'll gain weight, see stretch marks on your body or even get diagnosed by diabetes or even something even more serious like a stroke, heart attack, and organ failure.

Everyday people accomplish things for example: work people who work in construction have to work through some harsh conditions when its freezing or when its flaming hot. From my experience of working in construction I was a laborer working for ten hours, I as a laborer had to make sediment, mix for placing cinder blocks, carry buckets of water, cinder blocks, fill in the the holes with concrete, had no breaks only lunch, set up scaffolds and lift long heavy wooden planks and climb up and set the pallets of cinder blocks and water for the mix so it doesn't dry.

A Japanese manga artist named Akira Toriyama, the creator of Dragon Ball and Dr. Slump, even though both stories are fantastic but the one who stuck out the most is Dragon Ball. a young Akira saw a manga tournament who had the best manga it took him a couple tries to win and that lucky day he saw a editor from Toei Animations and told Akira great job from there he got confident and inspired that he could make something happen. later on he kept making mangas until he made one called dragon boy and one other manga and he combine both them and created dragon ball, he created Goku the main character and gave him the personality of Akira. Akria sold more than nine million copies of dragon ball from that money he made a studio call Bird Studio for his animations. Once Dragon Ball got so popular in Japan Toei Animations bought the anime from Akria and made the next Dragon Ball series called Dragon Ball Z. Dragon Ball has been around 32 years since it released in the U.S. and it still going and getting more popular. This year in January 14 the new Dragon Ball Super Broly came out in the U.S. and made one hundred million in the box office, one of the most famous anime and one of the best selling anime movies of all time.

5FC3C342E64E,"I agree with this statement because you are capable of doing anything you want. Just because you have mastered something it does not mean that you cant do anything beyond what you have mastered. Having to master something can be a very big accomplishment to people including myself. Mastering one thing is good but mastering more than one thing is a huge accomplishment. Everyone can go beyond what they have mastered you just have to try and never give up and you will have mastered anything you want. Mastering something takes time and dedication its not just something you can do over night. It might take days, months, years who knows how long but at the end pretty sure it will be worth it.

There are many things people can be mastered at such as teaching, playing football, etc. Just because you have mastered one thing it does not mean that you should be done mastering other things beyond what you already have mastered. If i were a NFL superstar it does not mean i cant go to school and become a doctor also when you retire you would have something to do. Thats an example of what you do to go beyond what you have mastered. Some people are born with skills and for them all they have to do is fully master it. Mastering is a skill that allows you to personally get a hang of what your best interest are. If you want to master something there a variety of ways to do so such as go to college or a camp etc.

Mastering something is not very easy it takes time and dedication thats why doctors take approximately 12 years to get the highest degree in becoming a doctor. I strongly agree with author Ralph Waldo Emerson cause if you dont master beyond your intentions you will not grow. This is true because there are many things to do in this world to not be mastered at only one thing. What it means by you will never grow up is because you will stay at the same level Intel you unlock your full potential. This is a great quote for someone who was trying to master one thing in there life but after reading this quote it will help them realize that they can master more than one thing.

This is a example on if you become a master at one thing and get lazy you will never grow up cause you have only mastered one thing in your life. Life it self is a precious gift and special skills are to so take advantage of it and learn as much as possible. So if you go above and beyond what you have mastered you will be a good and grown person. Its good in life to be good at just more than one thing cause it will help you in many ways such as getting jobs or getting in to schools. If you have more than one skills you could do anything you desire in life which is a good thing. That will be all for my S.A."
2327EC67A339,"I do not agree with studying the business i want to do in high school. i will not be fully mature . i will not not have good experience . even if thats the job i want to do when i grow up i still wouldn't want to go to school just for that specific reason to start a business right after that . i understand that some people would love to do that . but i really do not think it's the right idea.

many people would of take that opportunity but i wouldn't because sometime not what you want in life is good for you. i personally do not think it will be the right idea . i want to go to high school to learn about new things. learn about new carrer . i do not want to want to go to high school just to learn about a specific carrer job . i will not have much experience . i will get bored but doing the same thing over and over . some people do love doing that but i think its going to be a waste of my time. what if by the time i graduate high school and get tired of it and i want to change it . i dont think itsw will be fun or good for me . but i will have to start every all over just because of that . you are going to miss all the opportunity you had in high school .

you going to have to go pay for collgue to restart again . its going to be very stressfull for people .

I really want everybody to think very well before trying to start a business or try to go to school just to learn a specific job carrer . people should go to school and learn diffrent things and then choose after what they like over the time. they parent should allow them to do that because i do not thimg it's good at . many things could happen nobody will know about. they should also have more experience borfre trying to have businnes in high school . they aslo should have the compassion of it . if that's what they really want they schould let them do it . but i still think its worng . there are young they do not know what they are doing . whhat is his/her business do not work what are they going to ? they should be in high school to lear new thing not to do same thing over and over .

A1EC959B8C13,"Would it be surprising to know if students to know that students learning at home helps them not stress out as much? Stress is mainly caused by the students getting to much school work that cannot be handed in one night. Students complain about having too much homework and when working at home there is not any homework. Allowing any students to work on their own schedule help them become more motivated to work on their assignments. Students being educated at home gain more time to study and make up their own rules but responsible with it. Learning at home and not at school helps students to benefit themselves to get better grades.

One of the advantage of homeschooling is it can be done anywhere and at anytime. Because it can be done by a touch of a good night sleep, students rise up in morning fresh and have a flexible time schedule. The students can work around their parents schedule instead of the parent working around the student's schedule when it is time do some distance learning. Some students have trouble working at a school because they cannot understand the material at the pace set by teachers. The students cannot always work at the pace set by teachers. Distance learning allows students to work on their own pace and on their own schedule. Additionally, that there are no misguided rules about tardiness or how to dress. Because instead of worrying about the rules the students can focus on their studies. Distance learning can improve certain students learning process by having a more available schedule and by letting them learn in their own way.

When taking a test or notes at school there are many distractions that can make students lose focus on what they are doing. This is another reason that learning from home benefits students. Learning from home doesn't have the distractions that a classroom has. As a result of this, students won't lose focus on the work they are doing resulting in better grades. One of the reasons students get distracted in the first place is because they are in a class where other just fooling around which makes others who want to stay focus feel uncomfortable. If a student learns from home they will feel more relaxed and comfortable and won't stress about work. In school, you are stuck at a desk listening to the teacher's teachings for six hours and have a limited time to eat and take bathroom breaks. But there is other way around, if you are home, you can eat and do what you want when you want. Because of this, students will feel less pressured and get better grades then they would have if they were in school.

There are still a few reasons not to do distance learning. There many more opportunities with public and private schools. People from different colleges don't go to student's homes and try to advertise their career options. Making friends from home would be difficult without social interaction. Public and Private schools are great places to socialize during free time. If everyone goes home to attend school, funding for public schooling will fall and teachers will lose their jobs because of budget cuts. In public schools and private schools, depending on the teacher, cheating is hard to do. On the other hand, schooling at home, the students can easily look up the answers on the internet on a different device. So for all that matter it was you choose from not what want, it what you need.

Students should be offered classes online or at home because it is less distracting and less stressful. The flexibility of the time students are allowed to complete work would benefit the mental health and grades of the student. With a more flexible schedule, students would be more likely to succeed and make good grades. Even though socialization in the school environment allows students to make friends. The conclusion of the argument was that it is highly doubtful that the lack of interaction could affect the student in adulthood. Many students all over the world successfully take some, and even all classes from home. In the near future, school systems and all districts should provide distance learning."
7C5E4E2779BF,"I'm agree with Emerson's restatement, in my point of view or personality I can say that I want to be a different person with another qualities, create other ways to think how big or how much I can do to show to the world my authentic and proper knowledge, when I have to make a decision I don't have to think too much about it, I believe in what I'm doing. When you think to be a real person and someone different to the rest, you need to have a plan that consist step by step and develop that plan in the course of your life to make goals to short time and large period of time, be patient with each little detail that you want to do.

For example:

If yo want to do something that you think that is impossible for any reason, you don't have to leave that idea or goal that you have in mind, remember that all you need is work hard, be simple and don't complain for any problem or reason that tomorrow will have a lot of consequences.

At this time, the people and no one wants to see another person having their own goals or their dreams that they had when they were children. Every single person will try to impress to your attention to turn down your attitude and your positive life, I have too many experiences that I never want to pass that process again, in this world exist all type of people that want to help, to destroy your intention or the ways to see the real things, you're a guide and an example to change the format in this age. When you have a purpose that everyday make changes in your personal life or something like motivation to do anything that that have a great value to demonstrate to you family that they are the base to all of your goals have worth. A big percentage of people want to be rich, and my way to think about it, is that all thing that's material it doesn't have a real value for a great and humble person, the value is something that makes you having a great family, a simple life, because the world need to be protected by several and carefully people that are interesting in show another face to represent a different type of humanity.

Be an individual person is how you you can to do to confront the reality and give another perspective to make a great research in your your period of life to change or keep using that type of life and really cares about what are you doing with an specific and central idea.

I have a positive and big action to say that Emerson is right because nobody wants to be the shadow of any person or leave an opportunity that will make the life of one or more person to decide to experiment a new way to see the society and doing the correct process to be an excellent human with integrity and feeling of better life.

My conclusion for this restatement is that I want to be myself with great intentions to form an integrity in this society and have the best recognition to prove that it's possible to make and develop a proper identity with a new perspective to imagine and be the next person in the world that makes you a connection with your interior and have peace to concentrate in own goals that will converting on a genuine person to be autonomous of your acts, be someone responsible, charismatic and all of these characteristics define your personality it doesn't matter where yo come from or where you at, just be an example that if I can do this, you can do it better than me and better as you want.

DB85B6DDB462,"Once a British naturalist and politician John Lubbock said, ""your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.""and some people believe thats true and I agree with them. I believe that we our self choose our own character traits because no matter who you are influenced by you make your own decisions. Yes, there maybe others who will be in your life time their to persuade you to do bad things but its up to you if you want to stay with those kinds of people.

First of all your character is something that make you,you and thats whether you choose to be good or bad, nice or mean. Their are many different types of people in the world and they have their own characters.

Secondly all people are different and special in many ways like people could help others, they could donate their time to help the elderly, they could spend time with loved ones, or they could do bad things like stealing and other stuff like that but that all comes from you, you decide to do all those thing whether good or bad that your traits as a human being.

Last of all people with bad and good traits can change whether you decide to or not its all up to you nobody else's. People can change in many ways possible you your self just have to decide if that's what you want to do.

In conclusion John Lubbock a British naturalist and politician said that ""your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" and I believe thats true. but its also true that some people some people may influence the way you act like who you grew up with, people who were role model's to you, or people who motivated you in your life time. In other words I believe people choose who they want to be and how they want to act like cause its who they are it's their character. "
FA2DE7E82907,"It's has been saying people learn from their mistakes in order to accomplish a goal. Keep those mistakes out make them less likely to build self-esteem. True self-esteem come from achievement because is better point the mistakes in order to success.

Point the errors keep student away to avoid do it next time, for example if a junior student is about to take the SAT exam ; he decide to practice math problems .His math teacher decide to check his work, and he think praise his work is good because make him feel less worried about the exam, but the truth is making feel better is not helpful because he is not gonna get enough knowledge about his problems. I could say he is going to feel much better with a high score in his exam.

Lower the possibility to gain knowledge because the student in some point would have to use their knowledge it could be in college, at their job, and home. Like in my sophomore year I had a English teacher who praise most of my work because she thought that would in increase my knowledge, but was the opposite I felt like I was going backward instead of forward. I found praising a student work make them learn less in the way if they have something wrong students would have to look for answer, so that mean if they find what they did wrong is a chance of increase their knowledge because they might find more than just the answer that they are looking for.

Student learn for their mistakes it's much better point those mistakes out than hide it form them. Eventually student that don't show improvement are the ones that the teacher decide hide their errors because it's better clear the doubt. Like a kindergarten student they asked a lot of question to the teacher, and most of the time the teacher correct their work to let them know what did they do wrong to improve their work. It would not make sense that the teacher tell to the all student that they know all the alphabet just to make them feel better, so the students could stop learning and focus in other activities like math, social studies, or even play. Praising is not good as we thought because can make us be okay with our work, and not encourage us to learn.

while some may say praise student work could keep the working to make them improve and build self-esteem, actually student learn form their mistakes, and it's better point it out than hide it from them because an error doesn't mean failure meant the student is improving to success. with the success comes the self-esteem."
53E542321463,"Dear Principal,

I agree with what you think but sometimes students need sport so that they can think better. I am in a sport and I wouldn't like to miss my sport. I believe students should keep playing sports but their grade average should go up at least to a B. I am worthy that students grades will go up.

Think about it's if the students are in sports because you nor their parents would want them out of the house to go with a group of bad people. so think about what I am telling you then write back. I hope you agree with what i am writing. Just think that you were a kid without sport and out in the street with those bad people.

57D4C53890E6,"should students be required to take a music class, a drama, or an art class. Some will agree and some wont. Every student has diffents talents, or are intrested in diffrent activities and subjects. Why cant students have the advantage of chosing class that fit to there prefrance. Studnets should be able to take a class that is intresting to them that does'nt have to do wwith music, drama, or art. Some students would like to take class for the opportunity of graduate earily. Others would like to take classes that are based on future careers that are intreging to them.

Having to take a class that is based on art or drama and not being good or intrested in it must be a little fustrating to a studnet. Studnets most likely will lose focuse or wonder off in class if not intrested. Sometimes might even oviod the class. As a studnet myself i amdit that losing focuse in class when not being intrested came very easy to me. Not only does it cause the sttudent fustraction but it also causes the teacher fustration to see a student not pertesapating in class.

School is a piec of pie for some students and having to take classes that are an easy A seems to be a wast of time for some studnets that would like to get high school over with and jump right into college. Some high school provide studnets free college credit classes that benifits fanatuly wise and skill wise. Having more then enough credits helps the student one graduate early and two have credits even before starting college. Taking advance classes or college credit classes looks really good on college resmates.

What if the students would have the advantge of having a glance of the career that they are intrested during high school. Not ever studnets know the career or path that they would like to take during high school, but some stduents do know. Also why not giving those students that are confused or lost about what career they would like to mager in college an opprtunity to expermant classes during high scchool. For example in my high school there is a program called career center where high schoolers are able to take classes that are based on intrest that they have some examples; cooking classes, amimal science, tec, child care and ect. Imagin if every student had the opprtunity to expermint careers early.

Every studnet has diffrent skills and intrest. why cant the school system benfit every student and give the opprtunity to make a students distuction a lot more easir when it comes to what intrest the student and choosing what colleges to attend to. Not every studnent is the same why treat them the same way. "
631F9CBDFD7A,"Would doing school work at home benifit you? Working from home would benifit me because I can take breaks whenever I need to, as some students like work on the computers, and may see their family.

First, when working from home I can take breaks so I don't get stressed or angry. Some students need time to finish their assignments and not be counted as late. Students possibly have late assigments because they get stressed during school hours and they don't want to do it at home. However, if they work from home, they can complete those assignments at anytime and still get a 100%.

In addition, some students like to work on the computers better than on paper. For example: I like working on the computers because I like to multitask, so in this case I prefer working on the computers more then on paper. Mulltitasking is better for me because I like to listen to music and do some homework. Multitasking is a skill and not everyone has it.

Lastly, some students don't want to leave their family and prefer to be at home. For example: I have a sister that can't leave my mom, and I bet that she prefers doing school work from home. Personaly I prefer working from home and not leave my family. However, we do need to leave them at least when we're 20-21 or sooner. Working from home would benifit me because I get to be on the couch and not be sitting under the desk. I do like the confert at my house better then in public scools.

Overall, Working from home would benifit me because I like to work on the computers, I can take breaks, see my family, and be on my couch."
420269F2DE40,"Teenagers are really complicated these day's not trying to have an extra 2 hours in school.

They want to have school already to be over so they can do what ever they want to do. They think having school for a little more time is a waste of time. I agree not having school for an extra 2 more hours, it's a problem for us student's.

Teacher's have a problem when a student goes to sleep the flip out and start's to scream even the other side of the hallway teacher or student's can hear them. I agree on not having 2 more hours,student not getting enough sleep, also begin bored not doing work, and begin stressfull.

Student's these day's are alway's sleeping in class saying their not getting enough sleep. When teenager's are not getting enough sleep they start to sleep in class and not do their work. Reason why our teenager's are not getting enough sleep it's because they got their extra 2 hours of school. My teenager leaves the school late and also get home an extra hour late my teenager barley's get's his homwhork done on time. When it's time to sleep my teenager doesn't sleep why it's because he doesnt feel sleepy at all from coming home late.

Student's have a big issue on begin happy and having fun in school. Teenagers are saying if they have an extra 2 hours of school their going to be boring and also not doing their work. Student's will not listen to thet teacher of how bored their are in class. Student is not going to follow instruction by the teacher because it's a waste of time. Teenagers have a problem when their are bored they don't follow what the teacher is doing instead they talk to other classmate so they could be unbored.

Ever since the 2 extra school hour started student are having trouble to keep up to turn in their class work.

Teenagers are really worried to get their grade's up on time. Student's trying their best to turn in any late classwork they have for the teacher's. Teacher's worry's about their student why aren't they getting enough sleep. Teenagers parent are stared to realizing an extra 2 hours are stressfuling their student's.

Teacher are tried of seeing their student's sleeping in class. Student's not following instruction on what the teacher is saying because their bored. Student's having more hours in school are getting stressful.      "
EF45D0314A20,"Almost 95% of people goes to the beach or swimming pools, and I imagined what enjoyable activity to do. I think swimming club is the most enjoyable activity. Swimming is an enjoyable activity because it helps me calm whenever i'm mad, I can also swim with my friends and play together, and it is also more easier and exciting to exercise whenever i'm swimming.

First of all, swimming is an enjoyable activity because it helps me calm whenever i'm mad or feeling down. Last year, when the school just finished, and all of the people left, I jumped into the pool and just swam. It made me happy because as I swam into the surface of the water, I heard the water droplets drop as I moved my feet up and down, the sound of the wave made me sleepy as they touched the wall, and the sound of the gushing water that made me feel alive as I went out of the pool. Another example would be, when I was on a field trip, we all went to the beach and stayed there for two days. As the day goes by, I was sad and upset because I didn't want to leave. What I did was I changed my clothes, took my camera, and went outside. As I walk on the sandy beach, I heard the waves as if they were ready to eat me, I heard the birds chirping as I take a picture of them. It was a very fun and calm day. That is why swimming is an enjoyable activity because it helps me calm.

Second of all, swimming is an enjoyable activity because you get to swim with your friends, even make new friends! An example would be when I was swimming alone, I was okay because I don't really mind being alone, but when my friends came, they instantly made me laugh. All of us were doing tricks and racing with each other, which is very fun. One time, when my friends was swiming underwater, they bumped each other's head and as they reach to the surface, three of us laughed. Also, learning how to swim is easier because swimming is fun, and it's more fun with your friends. An example would be your friend can help you out when you're struggling how to float. Even doing dog swim is hard for some people, which is easy for me. Also, learning by yourself isn't fun, learning with your friends is more fun. That is why swimming is an enjoyable activity because you get to swim with your friends.

Lastly, swimming is an enjoyable activity because it's mpre exciting to exercise when you're swimming. I once took a swimming lesson every friday after school. I didn't like it at first, but as soon as my third day came, I liked it so much. I gained 145 pounds for a ten year old, but when I took my swimming lesson, my weight decreased to 111 pounds. You don't really see the result, until you started having fun on what you're doing. An example would be I was really not into swimming and all I wanted to do there is to lose weight. I didn't see any improvement onj my swimming skills, and I didn't lose weight at all. Weeks passed and I started losing weight, and im becoming more better at swimming. I thought is because I got more passionate and determined when swimming that I didn't see those changes. After all what i've been through, swimming made me happy at all times. That is how swimming impacted my life.

It's more exciting and easier to exercise when swimming, you can swim with your friends and play together, and it helps me calm whenever i'm mad, and that is why swimming is an enjoyable activity. It is important for people to know this is because this is a real life story. It already helped three people when they read this. Swimming club is an enjoyable activity."
DF1D43973CFA,"My opinion about If school students have to a four-day school week. The students and teachers can get more a free dar, that day we can take sleep, study for other you need study someting, enjoy with your family, develop your self and what do I want to do. I can have many good someting for you. But the other days, you have the school day two more hours. You need think about now. We have seven hour on school, you dose not tired for long times in school? The seven hour is very long time,

every early morning all students wake up the may de am 5:30 or 6:00, you need take prepare to go to school, and stay there for seven hour. But if we have a four-day school week and expending the school day two hours, you should loss the two hours from many something. For example, I can't have a sleep, study for you need know someting, enjoy with my family, develop my self, and what do I want to do. Because of we have a four-day school week and expending the school day two hours. If we have two more hour in school, we need stay two more hour in school, more study. I don't want to lossing my five day's happy and free. We need more think about what is really good for us. "
